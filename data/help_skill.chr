Help on skill:     Steady metabolism
Usage duration:    automatic
Skill type:        special
Affecting stat(s): skill percent

While the magic users of the realm can avoid the throes of close combat,
or deflect and repair any damage sustained, melee fighters do not enjoy
these luxuries. Those on the front lines of combat must prepare to take
their lumps, and learn to survive even while sustaining massive damage.
Experienced close-range combatants fare better at this, and can train
their bodies to self-heal during combat. The rate of recovery is seldom
comparable to regeneration in a resting state, but it reduces the need
for downtime in between fights.

Because they metabolize in other ways, this skill has no effect on members
on the death knight legion.

Help on skill:     Cavalier's charge
Usage duration:    random
Fatigue:           low
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): strength, dexterity, cavalier's charge, charge, mounted attack
                   and horsemanship

For a foot soldier nothing is as terrifying as a mounted knight approaching at
a full gallop, especially if the said knight is brandishing a polearm. While
such a charge is not the quickest of attacks, it is certainly devastating.
Knowledge of horsemanship is paramount for this type of an attack, for not
everyone can command their steed onto a headlong charge amidst awaiting enemies
and their weapons.
While this type of an attack relies mostly on brute force, some agility is still
necessary for the handling of the steed and the long weapon at full gallop.
This maneuver can be performed with any polearm, but it is the most effective
with those of the thrusting type. Heavier weapons are also more effective than
their lighter counterparts, due to the momentum provided by their greater weight.

---------------------------------------------------


Help on skill:     Eviscerate
Usage duration:    random
Fatigue:           very low
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, strength, dexterity and constitution

A basic, quick attack with a bladed weapon, mainly aimed at the center of mass,
favoured by the less skilled combatants. It is potentially very effective but
quite unreliable for the broad and often wild swings are predictable and easy to
block or avoid altogether.

This attack can be executed using either one or two weapons of type axe, sword,
polearm or bladed ancient. If either 'blood harvest' or 'gravesmite' is trained,
can also be used with a bludgeon or a bludgeoning ancient as the second weapon.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:  Ruinous utterance
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     knowledge

While all death knights can wield destructive magics effectively, the
Nightweavers are among them the most adept. In their hands such spells may even
come to rival those of true sorcerous masters. But the most feared weapon in
their arsenal is the pure destructive power of the Shadow which the Nightweavers
wield with terrifying prowess.

Help on skill:  Rites of the grave
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     knowledge

Much of the magic of the death knights tap into the essence of the undead or
death itself - such spells have been dubbed 'rites of the grave'. While these
spells may differ greatly from each other in purpose and complexity they all
share the same source. Through this general aptitude into wielding such power
is each individual spell, or a rite of the grave, improved.

Help on skill:     Deadslam
Usage duration:    random
Fatigue:           minimal
Skill cost:        105 SPs
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, strength, constitution and intelligence

The grave warden is a recognizable figure on the field of battle, wielding heavy
bludgeons that move with languid pace while each blow lands with seemingly
impossible force, enough to send shockwaves through the air. They achieve this
spectacular yet terrifying feat by augmenting their strikes with magic,
effectively adding more weight behind their weapons. With a delivery such as
this the use of already heavy weaponry can be of great benefit.

This attack can be executed using either one or two bludgeon-type weapons,
including bludgeoning ancients.

---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:  Fell insights
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     knowledge

The special brand of magic the death knights wield can be extremely taxing,
especially without proper training. It is also largely unaffected by the methods
of conventional magics. To this end the death knights have had to come up with
their own set of theories and teachings. These fell insights will help death
knights combat the magical strain of their dark spells.

---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:  Fell warding
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     knowledge

The death knights are far from adepts of defensive magics, and their methods and
temperament are rarely suited to such a passive approach but through considerable
training they can conjure at least adequate wards. 

Help on skill:  Unhallowed magic
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     knowledge

The magic of the death knights is very different from any other: they use
themselves as the source and the focus of their magic, channeling the deathless
within, making their spells seem much like natural abilities rather than
constructions of the arcane. To master these unhallowed magics one must first
grasp the fundamental, the theory of invocation.

---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:     Gravesmite
Usage duration:    1 round
Fatigue:           minimal
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, strength, constitution and dexterity

The dread reaper who favours bludgeons is a terrifying warrior, not necessarily
for the devastation that his strikes cause but because he is the unrelenting
undead who delivers one blow after another with singular focus and an unnaturally
steady pace until either he or his opponent lies dead on the battlefield.

This attack can be executed using either one or two bludgeon-type weapons,
including bludgeoning ancients. If either 'eviscerate' or 'blood harvest' is
trained, it can also be used with a suitable blade wielded as the second weapon.

---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:     Grim resolve
Usage duration:    automatic
Skill type:        special
Affecting stat(s): skill percent and constitution

While all warriors have the potential for developing their willpower in order
to stand firm against the crippling effects of fear and confusion and other
such maladies that can lead to their demise, the death knights have a distinct
advantage over the common warrior: they are all already dead. As such this type
of training for them is not so much about will as it is about getting rid of any
vestiges of mortality and any lingering qualms.

Help on skill:     Vile totem
Usage duration:    1 round
Skill type:        neutral
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, intelligence, rites of the grave and
                   profanities

As a final act of desecration the corpse of an enemy is used to erect a vile
totem, wreathed in dark magic. Upon its completion this unholy monument will
release a surge of energy that will rejuvenate the totem's creator and all
undead beings in the vicinity as well as they creator's allies even if they
were living.
While the vile totem stands its presence will continue to demoralize all
weaker living beings.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:     Blood harvest
Usage duration:    random
Fatigue:           mediocre
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, strength, dexterity, constitution and
                   eviscerate

While highly skilled in the use of bludgeons, the blades are the signature
weapons of the dread reapers. And they wield these weapons of war with single-
minded focus to a bloody harvest, an unyielding and uncaring culling of all
life. Their techniques may not seem like much but anyone having faced a dread
reaper can attest that what they lack in flair they more than make up with their
implacable efficiency.

This attack can be executed using either one or two weapons of type axe, sword,
polearm or bladed ancient. If either 'gravesmite' or 'deadslam' is trained, it
can also be used with a bludgeon or a bludgeoning ancient as the second weapon.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Profanities
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     knowledge

The death knights are the epitome of anti-life, the very existence of these
dark champions a desecration of all that lives, and their profane rituals a
mockery of that which is pure. Through these profanities they strike fear into
the hearts of their opponents, sap their morale or turn their dead against them.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:  Eldritch weave
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     knowledge

Although not true masters of such esoteric arts the death knights make extensive
use of the Shadow, weaving this darkest of forces into the magics. But such an
amalgamation is volatile and nigh impossible to control without proper training.
Through the mastery of this "eldritch weaving" are all such spells made more
reliable.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on skill:     Reaping stance
Usage duration:    random
Skill type:        special
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, constitution, strength and grim resolve

The dread reaper is effectively both the unstoppable force and the immovable
object, relying in battle on his astounding and terrifying ability to withstand
horrible injuries while slowly but relentlessly grinding all opposition into
dust.

By assuming the reaping stance, the undead begins the inexorable march towards
his doomed foes which ends only when either he or his enemies lie dead on the
ground. While thus single-mindedly focused on battle, the dread reaper cannot be
reasoned with or bargained with for he will not stop or withdraw, not even to
preserve his own existence.

The reaping can be begun passively, waiting for a target to present itself, or
actively by challenging an opponent.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Adrenaline rush.
Usage duration: 2.
Mental Cost: 150 SPs.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent.
With this skill, a monk can take advantage of his mastery of his mind to
aid in combat. By using this skill, the monk summons control of his mental
abilities to force his glands to release a burst of adrenaline, which
rushes through his bloodstream and provides his muscles with extra power
and speed, greatly enhancing his combat abilities. Unfortunately, this
depletes the muscles'natural ability to cleanse themselves of toxins and
restore fuel, and the result is that after the adrenaline leaves the
monk's bloodstream, he is left weaker and sluggish for a time.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Advanced martial arts.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
While even an inexperienced monk may be able to complete a great number of
martial arts techniques competently, there are several that can be mastered
only by someone of advanced training. These techniques may look overly
flashy and useless in practice to someone who is not familiar with them,
they are in fact just the opposite, highly specialized and necessary
techniques that make a truly experienced monk capable of doing vast
amounts of damage. This skill describes a monk's total knowledge of
advanced martial arts techniques.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Aegis.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Ambidextrous attack.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
This skill comes as a necessary part of a monk's training in unarmed
combat. Nearly all monks naturally favor one leg over the other, and
one arm over the other as well, when it comes to completing martial
arts techniques. This is clearly dangerous, since it often results in
the monk missing opportunities to strike at his opponent. To correct
this natural behavior, monks are taught to fight equally well with
both sides of their body, and to ignore their natural preferences,
and then to be able to strike at the opponent as often and well as
possible, taking advantage of all openings in the defense. This skill
describes that training.

Help on skill: Appraise.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: neutral.
This useful skill is used to evaluate the approximate value of an item.
Your knowledge in this skill determines how accurately you are able to
appraise items. For valuable items, appraise only gives rough estimates
of the values. The values reported indicate the worth of the item if sold
in the shops of the realm, private entrepreneurs may pay very different
amounts for items that they find to be of use.

Help on skill: Arcane focus.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
This powerful skill allows a cleric to exert a great amount of sacred power

skills to be tumbled less.
This skill is automatically in use.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Arcane lore.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
This skill acts as a mastery skill for the clerical spells/skills. It is
known that no priest can truly reach the extent of his/her powers without
good knowledge of the secret arts. By combining the effects of different
spells a cleric can create spells more powerful than anyone could have
thought, perhaps even lessening the exhaustion caused by casting a spell.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Attack.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): dex and weapon.
This skill allows you to score successful hits in combat.
Attack is the most fundamental skill of the melee related
skills. Only after a successful attack it is possible to
score stuns, criticals, doublehits and other higher forms
of damaging your opponent. Attack skill alone does not make
you a warrior, but it serves as the basis for many of the
skills. Attack percent is also modified by your Parry
setting if you have proficiency in it.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Attend wounds.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: heal.
Too often the only bandages you have on the battlefield are your two
hands, and all too often the less brave spellcasters are nowhere to be
found. In situations like this, any good fighter needs to know the
principles of attending wounds without supplies or magic. What you can
do is not much, but sometimes the slightest attendance can make the
difference between life and death. Sometimes its enough to just care
for the wounded, without any actual healing.

Help on skill: Backslash hit.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Special.
A long time ago a group of minotaurs mastered combat to the perfection
and found new combatsequence for a ferocious offensive move, Backslash
Hit. This skill, with the help of the Combat Trance, a skilled warrior
can take advance of every possible opening in the combat, dealing out even
more lethal blows than any other warrior. This skill can be learned by
any race, but only minotaurs can take full advantage of this skill.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Balance momentum.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon whirling mastery.
Excluding creatures of strictly inhuman strength, no one is able to keep a
bludgeon in motion with raw strength alone. Initial strikes can easily be
powered by muscle alone, but in any prolonged fight it is the momentum of
the bludgeon that does most of the work. In order to keep your bludgeon in
constant motion, it is critical to place your blows so that they hit the
armored or otherwise hard bits of your opponent. A blow to the gut can
prove most painful, but it all too often results in the loss of momentum
so that the fighter will have to force the maul to swing again. It is
possible to learn the finer points of whirling your cudgel to a point,
but the rest will come with the knowledge of organs required to balance your
blows so that maximum damage is inflicted with the minimal loss of momentum.
The fighters proficient in this skill and mauling can also estimate the
the amount of momentum their weapons currently have by simply typing:
'momentum'. Higher skill gives more accurate estimations.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Bargain.
Usage duration: automatic.

This skill allows you to effectively haggle
purchases to a lower price.  It is automatically
in use at all possible times.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Bash.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str.
A shield-bash, however strong you might be, will probably prove non-
lethal unless the opponent in question is the size of a squirrel, but in
comparison to using your bare fists without any sort of martial arts
training, the weight of the shield can be a good advantage. Also, if
an opponent is prepared against a maneuver with your primary weapon, the
sudden bash from the other side may surprise him, possibly interrupting
his own actions.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Battle hardness.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Neutral.
There is a saying among the humans who soldier for a living;
'A seasoned soldier is a quilt of scars', which describes
the hardness of a creature that has been slashed, stabbed,
set on fire, impaled and tortured before he turned thirteen.
Professional men-at-arms such as these know exactly how badly
they have been hit, and quite often, precisely what caused
the damage.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Battle lore.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type:     Special.
A long time in the battle has generated a knowledge, which
helps to know how combat would proceed. This knowledge allows
user to proceed in greater swiftness and precision in battle.
With that precision, Combat Trance is more effective.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Battle tactics.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
The benefit of rough hand-to-hand training is learning how to anticipate the
movement and thoughts of your opponent. Having the determination and skill to
deliver the fatal blow at the precise moment of your opponent's error can cause
devastating amounts of damage. This, and knowing the value of discipline is
what makes men of arms superior leaders in comparison to the spellcasting
guilds; who, despite their wisdom lack the gift of making quick decisions.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Battlecry.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
The purpose of a battlecry before an onslaught is two-fold. On the one
hand it helps you to raise your morale, while on the other hand it invokes
fear within the ranks of your enemies. Experienced fighters often begin their
combat with a bloodcurdling battlecry if they have the initiative. A well
performed battlecry combined with a bold attack can make anyone it is
targeted at freeze in terror, even if the actual damage done is quite low.
This skill can only be used in the beginning of combat.

Help on skill: Berserk.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): con.
The Fighters' Guild has often suffered from the mockery of the guilds that
consider their techniques more delicate, and not the least because of the
art of berserking. What looks like mad, uncontrolled rage to outsiders, is
actually something you must practice over and over again to successfully
use to your best advantage. A berserking fighter is bolstered in several
ways if he controls it. The fighter's strength, bravery and pain tolerance
raise according to the level of his training, and contrary to what other
guilds like to think, they remain in full control of their actions. The art
of berserking at will is mastered through the ability to control the
body's functions by mere will alone. The origin of this way was lost
in the tides of time, but the native barbarian tribes of the realm are
often assumed to be the likely source. Several other skills are linked
to this technique, and to take full advantage of the barbarian tribes'
heritage, achieving a high level of mastery in all of them is recommended.

Skill type: attack.
This skill is used for powerful attack maneuvers
with edged weapons. The damage caused by this
skill is based on your weapon, stats and skill
knowledge.
Note: this skill is most effective when using
 two edged weapons (axe, dagger, polearm
 and sword), and only edged weapons.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Bless.
Usage duration: 3.
Skill type: neutral.
Priests of power can call a blessing from the god upon a faithful worshipper.

This skill provides trader information about different kind of bookkeeping
skills. And helps him with his daily business. With this skill he/she can
handle more items and money in his booth.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Bravery.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
A berserking fighter is able to ignore pain and horror of the battle
by becoming so enraged and fierce that any personal loss becomes trivial.
The technique of berserking gives some of these advantages alone, but all
fighters experience a large scale of emotions in any combat. The most
meaningful of those should be mastered with individual and targeted
exercises. Bravery teaches the berserker to control the terror and fear
that much larger or more numerous opponents may inflict upon him.
The conditioning, if properly learnt, is so strong that the berserker
might even be able to resist magical means of frightening him.
Note: Bravery works automatically in conjunction with Berserk.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Brawl.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
This skill is actually a combination of different talents that all
have to do with being proficient in using different weapons of the ancients
weapons class. These weapons can be roughly divided to four subcategories:
puncturing weapons, bladed weapons, whips and different bludgeons.
This skill teaches its master to effectively use all of these odd weapons
with such deadly force that a skilled brawler is a terror to any opponent.
The damage caused by this skill is based on your weapon, physical statistics
and skill knowledge in brawl and dirty blow.
NOTE: these ancient weapons differ so much from each other that the damage
 caused by them can vary greatly. Whips cause great pain whereas mauls
 tend to cause vast internal damage.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Ca reo
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     Loc Ecsuram
Ca Reo is the elven word for Absence. Humans often take note of
the seemingly great presence of elves, the way they seem to
'belong' in their environment. This is because an elf experiences
life directly and presently, where humans waste much time worrying
over what has already happened and what is still to come. Because
elves exist so strongly in the present, their absence from other
states is just as great. After harvested to combatative use, this
trait makes the elvenkind profoundly hard to hurt, for not even a
greater god may hit you where you are not. This style of Loc Ecsuram
is complicated and requires specific concentration. You may do this
by typing 'ca reo' or 'absence' while focused in Loc Ecsuram.

Help on skill: Call for fire.
Usage duration: Random.
Mental Cost: 300 SPs.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): level and skill percent.
One of the main reasons monks are taught control over their minds is so that
they might master the elemental forces of the world around them, and capture
some of those forces into their knuckles through the use of the natural magic
their minds possess. This skill allows a mentally strong monk to capture the
warmth of the world around him and channel some of it into his knuckles,
literally setting them afire, so that the knuckles will burn the monk's
enemies in combat.

One of the main reasons monks are taught control over their minds is so that
they might master the elemental forces of the world around them, and capture
some of those forces into their knuckles through the use of the natural magic

nearby static electrical energy, charging his knuckles with intense electricity
so that they will shock the monk's enemies in combat.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Calm down.
Usage duration: 3.
Skill type: special.
A fighter who enrages himself to the point of berserking can prove to be
a very dangerous foe, not the least because of their near legendary
ability to ignore the pain they have suffered. There is no permanent
escape from the pain and the damage suffered though, so proper techniques
of calming down are required for the fighter to choose the moment he
becomes vulnerable.

Help on skill:     Charging lance.
Usage duration:    5.
Skill type:        attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, con and dex

With the help of this skill the warrior learns to launch a powerful polearm
based attack maneuver from the safety of his shield. Shield is so essential
part of the executing of this skill that it simply cannot be done without it.
Successful usage of this skill requires that the warrior has gained at least
some sort of knowledge about ranged tactics, but despite of results the speed
is always determined by the size of the weapon. It is also rumoured that
knowledge of skills battlecry and bash somehow aid the users of this skill.

Help on skill: Clot wounds.
Usage duration: Random.
Mental Cost: 50 SPs.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): level and skill percent.
The ability of a monk to use his mind to control his body is one of the
largest portions of the mental training experienced by a monk. One aspect
of this is the ability to mentally force the monk's blood to clot and scab,
effectively closing a small wound and providing a small amount of healing.
This takes more mental energy than would be expended by a true healer to
do the same healing with a spell, but nevertheless is very important for
a monk who fights without his friends to help him after the combat has
ended.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Combat sense
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     special

This skill teaches the warrior using a bludgeon and a shield combination
how to read the moves of his opponents and how to use those to his
advantage while using the skill batter. This skill also teaches some basic
information of human anatomy.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Commune.

to discover their god's attitude towards them. This skill will never
fail to grant the cleric his god's favor.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Composting.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: neutral.
This skill turns those nasty old corpses into small mounds
of environmentally friendly compost. The druid profits very
slightly from this, as it is relaxing, rewarding work.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Conceal spellcasting.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Spellcasting itself is a really difficult and sophisticated art. However
only true masters trained in this skill may try to cast their spells with
such proficiency that no one is able to notice the casting.
You can use the skill to toggle concealing on / off.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Concentrated swing.
Usage duration: random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, dex, con, race, doctrines, battle lore and skill percent.
Concentrated swing is propably the greatest combat manouver created by
Mi'otau warriors. It takes advantage of the best parts of the tools of
war and combines them into a cruel and devastating move. The trick with
this move is that it makes a great variety of combinations. This makes
countermoves against the skill troublesome, as the opponent never knows
what the outcome of the move will be.
This move greatly depends on weapons used, and to be effective it needs
two different types of weapons to be wielded. As stated earlier different
weapons have different effect to the outcome of this skill, and it is
battle dependant when a warrior gets an opportunity to land a hit. Thus
opponent will not know which of the two weapons lands a hit.
This skill requires the warrior to be in a focused state to be able to
follow and take advantage of the opponent's moves.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Concentration of harmony.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): wis.
This skill is checked every time you cast a spell requiring harmony.
It will decrease the randomness of the spell that is cast 
more towards your actual percent in the spell.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Confounding elegance.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, intelligence and charisma.
It is quite fascinating how the Magus Artiste have been able to develop
so effective methods for controlling their magics. Especially since none of
the Artiste really bother pondering why something works the way it does.
When a Magus Artiste alters any of their projectile spells, the spell
will most likely become more taxing, magically and sometimes physically.
But when these manipulations are done with more elegance, as if one was
performing a work of art, it was found that the additional drain on the
Artiste's magical energy is lessened. This strange approach has caused much
bewilderment especially among mages and sorcerers who seek to codify magic
and find the logic that governs its workings. It is truly confounding.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Conjure light.
Usage duration: 2.
Mental Cost: 20 SPs.
Skill type: neutral.
Similar to the ability of a monk to attract electrical energy to his
knuckles to aid in combat is the ability to attract a small amount of
this energy into a single point to serve as a light source, which will
follow the monk around. This is a simple skill for all but the most
inexperienced monks to use, requiring far less energy than that used
to electrify the knuckles, and less mental ability as well. Despite
that fact, this can be a very useful ability for a monk to have,
should he become lost in the dark and be of a race unable to see in it.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Consider.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: neutral.
This skill allows you to gain information about the target. The amount
and accuracy of the information depends on your skill percent. You can gain
information of the target's weapon class, hitpoints, armour class, strength,
spells, resistances, attacks and, if you get lucky, maybe even some special.
information. At the end you get an overall estimation of the target's
abilities.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Construct roost.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: building.
Bards, being jacks of all trades, aren't afraid to get their
hands dirty with some manual labor to pay the bills.  Their
learning eventually lets them learn the basics of carpentry
and allows them to create marvelous pigeon roosts.

Help on skill: Contemplate harmony.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): wis.
This skill is checked every time you cast harmony armour.
It helps increase the duration of the spell.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Convert.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: neutral.
Clerics may attempt to not only swap the target's alignment, but to
try and preach to a target about the merits of worshipping her god.
With convert, a cleric does just that. She launches into a tirade
about the virtues of whatever god she has devoted her life to in an
attempt to confuse and scare the target into worshipping that god.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Combat trance.
Usage duration: 6.
Skill type: Special.
Affecting stat(s): str, dex, con, battle lore, race and skill percent.
The minotaurs have focused on their weapons since the Incident and
through that focus became true masters in using them. Along that mastery
they have developed a certain rhythm which allows them to maintain their
pace in the heat of combat. That rhythm does not only keep their head clear
and mind observant, but helps them to see how the fight will develop.
Warriors under the combat trance are fearsome opponents, moving their
weapons with almost unnatural speed, strength and precision. It is recognized
that older and more experienced villagers of Mi'otau benefit more from
this trance.
For an outsider it almost seems that they can read the opponents mind, as
they are able to predict where the opponent is moving next, and be prepared
to take advantage of those movements.
This skill is a prerequisite for other combat moves designed by Mi'otaus
and because of the nature of this skill, the user cannot focus on the trance
while fighting being berserk.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Corpse skinning.
Usage duration: 15.

This skill lets you skin corpses to create leather goods.
Knowledge in skill wilderness survival will make these goods better

Help on skill: Critical.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Warriors proficient in this skill have been trained to spot openings
in their enemies' defence and to exploit them without mercy or hesitation.
Critical hits scored with any type of weapon can prove devastating to the
victim, especially if they are frequent. Knowledge in this skill increases
the chance of scoring critical hits.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Damage analysis.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.

about how much damage the target is taking from 
an offensive spell.
It is automatically in use.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Damage direction.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon placement mastery.
Once the basics of the various techniques are learned, it becomes quite
apparent to any soldier that controlling the bashes so that the brain,
not the bludgeon, decides where the next hit will land is very challenging.
To efficiently place your attacks, first hand knowledge of the ways your
bludgeons behave whilst in motion is required. While some of these basics
can be taught, the rest will only come with practice.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:     Dancing blade.
Usage duration:    4.
Skill type:        attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, con and dex.

In the proficient hands sword is a lethal instrument that can proverbially
dance in the air. Reaching that goal is, however harder for a warrior
who uses a shield. This skill teaches the basic techniques, which are
needed on the way towards that level of proficiency, and as a bonus the
fighter will also learn how use his shield as a supportive offensive
tool on the side of his sword. In order to reach the full potential of
this skill the fighter needs to deepen his knowledge by training bash and
the counterpart of this skill, protected blade.
Note:Executing this skill is slightly faster with small sized weapons
than what it is with larger weapons.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:     Deadly torrent
Usage duration:    random
Fatigue:           high
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): strength, dexterity, intelligence, attack, weapon skill, doublehit, whirlwind attack, slash, whirlwind slash, 7th attack, wild strike, anatomy and spot weakness

A more advanced martial technique of the spellblades, consisting of a series
of rapidly executed strikes against a single opponent. While the individual
strikes are usually far from spectacular, the overwhelming barrage can easily
throw even a well-trained opponent off-guard and off-balance. And as an added
threat this attack is typically heavily augmented with magic, making it nearly
a match for the techniques of martial masters.
This attack can only be executed with daggers, swords, polearms, or bladed or
piercing ancients.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Decisive blows.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
This bludgeon technique is one of the finer aspects of mauling. A skilled
mauler has adapted to the behavior of his weapons to the point that he can
quickly estimate where they will be within the next few seconds, thus he is
able to consider and place his attacks intelligently instead of simply
bashing when opportunity arises. When performed by a master, this technique
inflicts injuries that can easily prove fatal for a mediocre opponent.
The downside is that the maces need to be controlled very precisely, often
in the expense of momentum and raw power.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Dedicate spell.
Usage duration: 8.
Skill type: neutral.
This skill is used to invest a spell in a Millennium Wand or
Millennium Staff. Only spells known by the Druid may be dedicated
and the Druid's knowledge of the spell plays a part in the success
of the dedication.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Defend.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: defensive.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent.
Sometimes when your opponent proves to be extremely fiercesome in
hand-to-hand combat, it is strategically wise to concentrate on
defending yourself and let the other members of your warparty
deal the actual damage. A defending fighter uses his shield to
its full effect, placing it infront of his body and lowering down
to hide as much of himself behind it as possible. This tactic
is very effective against all forms of physical damage that the
shield can stop. The downside however, is that a berserking fighter
will utterly refuse to hide behind any object, and you need a shield
to perform this action. The quality and duration of the defense depends
on your skill percentage.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Dirty blow.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
Brawling with different weapons of the ancient weapons class is a technique
favored by many of the Fighters' guild. The range of different ancients is
quite wide, even though most agree on the best weapon of that sort.
A brawling fighter skilled in dirty blow is able to occasionally augment
the blows by playing them less than fairly. Exposed areas with nerve
concentrations, the groin, the eyes and other vulnerable parts of the body
are the common targets of these less than fair attacks. The shock of the
assault can often cause stun in the opponent, and it also augments the
damage inflicted. This skill works in conjunction with Brawl, and the
higher the level of knowledge in dirty blow, the more often these
special. attacks will appear. All is fair in love and war, and we only
have enough time in our lives to properly do one of those two.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Doctrine of the ancient.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Special.
The weapon itself does nothing without the real knowledge how it
should be used. While every weapon differs in size and shape, there
is even more to be known than that.
Mi'otau warriors have finessed their knowledge of the weapons to

With this skill Concentrated swing will be most effective when
right weapon is used.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Dodge.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: defensive.
The master of this skill is able to dodge, and thus avoid, hits in combat.
Animals and other creatures can be naturally gifted in avoiding hits by
dodging, but for humanoids who wish to avoid quick blows while carrying
weaponry and armour, training is required. High dexterity makes avoiding
blows easier, and so does the lack of encumberance. Dodge and Parry
work best if used together, but even alone Dodge can prove extremely
helpful for an adventurer who lives a life of risks.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Double maul.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
Anyone who has battled against an opponent with weapons designed for bashing
knows that a hard impact from a bludgeon, even if it doesn't stun you, can
easily cause disorientation for a short moment. This technique of battling
with bludgeons takes advantage of that effect. The mauler delivers the initial
blow from the secondary weapon with the hope of creating distraction, and
then proceeds to perform a deadlier bash with his stronger arm.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Doublehit.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Almost all types of warriors and rogues possess the training required to
execute a doublehit. Doublehit allows those trained in it to follow-up
their initial attacks with a second hit from both weapons if two
are wielded. The higher the knowledge in Doublehit, the more often
an additional attack will occur.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Earth lore.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill measures a Druid's knowledge of Earth Elemental magic.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Eerie fixation.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): skill perfect and dexterity.
A talented Magus Artiste is able to control the magical projectiles of
their spells far beyond the capabilities of a more traditional magician.
Not only is this control possible during the creation of the projectile
but also in flight, provided that the Artiste has received proper training.
Having knowledge of the methods of 'eerie fixation' will potentially allow
the Artiste to counter the maneuvering of an elusive target. This is rather
taxing however, increasing the magical drain of a spell, and will not always
be successful as the alteration of a projectile's course is not a precise
art and also demands for very quick reflexes.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Electric enchanting.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Knowledge in this skill improves the power of enchant arrow spell while
enchanting arrows with greater electric preference.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Elemental favor.

Help on skill: Elemental mastery.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill is a measure of a Druid's reputation among the
Elemental Lords. Whenever an elemental being attacks a
Druid, this skill is checked every round to see if the
elemental comes to its senses and breaks off the attack.

Help on skill: Enhance features.
Usage duration: 3.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): dex.
This skill allows you to mold the targets features
so that they are more pleasing to the eye. It can
be quite painful to the target, so make sure they
are not ill of heart. It will be more difficult to 
enhance an already beautiful person's features.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Enhanced riposte.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): str.
This skill deepens its master's knowledge in riposting, enhancing the
damage done with each riposte. The damage inflicted with a single
riposte is hardly ever sufficient to kill without prior damage,
but at a close fight even the smallest advantage can tip the scale.
How much the damage is enhanced depends on the level of the skill
percent and strength.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Epitaph.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: neutral.
Bards are nothing if not sticklers for records events as
they happen. Typically, the bard will insist they be
allowed to bury fallen adversaries and friends, inscribing
a little epitaph upon their headstone. when performing

Help on skill: Eternal shielding.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automatic.
This skill allows the necromancer to better control the spellcasting
process that creates the shields protecting his minions. Better knowledge
in this skill will yield longer durations for such spells.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Fast blow.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
Sometimes striking quickly at your opponent is more important than executing
a long and difficult technique, such as when an opponent is very nearly
dead, or attempting to flee. For these situations, a fast and simple
technique utilizing the superior speed of the hands is appropriate. This
skill describes such a fast, simple technique used by the monk with his
hands to quickly deal a small, but not insignificant, amount of damage.
Because of this simplicity, even an inexperienced monk can often execute
it quite well, and the advantages of strength and speed that come with
experience make it occasionally useful even to much more experienced ones.

Help on skill:     Fleeting auguries
Usage duration:    automatic
Skill type:        special
Affecting stat(s): intelligence, psionicist levels and art of telepathy

Despite the grandiose name this skill does not give the spellblade glimpses of the future. This talent originates from the psionicists who first joined the ranks of the spellblades, and relies on basic telepathics. During combat,the spellblade is able instinctively scan the surface thoughts of the opponent. This brief insight not only helps the spellblade dodge and parry
the opponent's attacks, but also improve his chances of tumbling any skills and spells the opponent may attempt and sometimes, a talented spellblade may even know beforehand what that skill or spell is.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Flip kick.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, dex, boot quality and acrobatics skills.
With this skill, the bard demostrates her versitility by
flipping in the air several times and delivering a boot
to the head on her opponent. The quality of the boots
and the bard's strength and acrobatics skills play a large
part in the amount of damage done, while her dexterity and
combat skills allow for a chance to stun or interrupt
her opponent.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Focus ki.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
While the Ki skill allows a monk to concentrate his energy on producing
a loud shout combined with a single powerful attack designed to stun an
enemy, knowledge of the technique of Ki alone is often insufficient to
accomplish that goal. To enhance the Ki skill, and as part of the mastery
of a monk's body, he will learn to focus all of his energy into that shout
and strike, and will greatly increase both the damage done and the intensity
of the stun delivered.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Focus kungfu attacks.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
While Kungfu may be considered the pinnacle of the training of a monk's
mastery over his body, a Kungfu which strikes critically at the enemy's
most undefended parts must be considered the pinnacle of its execution.
To accomplish this feat, the monk must be able to focus his entire body
into the execution of the Kungfu attack, relaxing and ignoring all else
for a brief moment. When this is accomplished, the Kungfu that results
will do significantly more damage to the enemy. This skill represents
a monk's ability to focus his Kungfu attacks in this manner.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Focus power.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Spell weaver skill.
Affecting stat(s): int.
All space manipulating spells such as disruption suffer from
a bad tendency of easily spreading through the fabric of space so

activated by the Awaken Talisman spell. Once awakened, anyone can
use a Talisman to focus one of their skills or spells, increasing
its effects. Power and duration depend on the skill with which a
Talisman was forged and awakened. Note that only the Druid that
Awakens the Talisman can take advantage of its full power. Other
Druids, and Bards, can take good advantage of the Talisman, with
other guilds being able to take advantage of only some of a Talisman's
power. Talisman's can NOT be focused on the following skills/spells:
awaken talisman
forge talisman
leadership
demon and devil lore
battle tactics
balance momentum
damage direction
bargain.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Greater vulnerability.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): wisdom.
Vulnerabilities are a perversion of the elemental shielding magic 
abjurers use actively. They are fundamental when dealing with 
resistant and tough enemies; The realm of Zombiemud is chock full 
of creatures that have developed impressive resistances against 
damage. Fortunately the School of Abjuration is equally impressive 
in their ability to breach these resistances. The vulnerabilities 
are an advanced form of magic that require much time to master, 
but are well worth the time put into them. This skill and the 
spell percents respectively will affect the outcome. 
It is automatically in use.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Grounding.
Usage duration: automatic.

Wand or Staff. This is especially useful if the charging
process should fail.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Hammer.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
Bludgeons are weapons that require little knowledge to use for moderate
results, yet those who choose to specialize in armed combat with mauls are
reluctant to say that any-a-man is a professional at birth if he only has
the strength to move a maul. Strength alone helps, but without the proper
techniques anyone would tire quickly in the heat of combat. This skill
covers the most basic of bludgeon techniques, how to hammer your opponents
without tiring yourself the first few seconds.
---------------------------------------------------

A monk who has trained extensively can combine his masteries over both his
body and mind, and cause himself to relax completely, redirecting all
energy towards the healing of the body and regeneration of mental energy.
While knowledge of this skill is available to all experienced monks,
those who take the time to truly master it through training of 'Mastery
of Healing Trance,' as part of their study of mastery of the mind will
experience noticably better results. Naturally, it is not possible for
the monk to achieve the concentration necessary for this skill while
fighting.

Help on skill: Hear noises.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: neutral.
It is hardly needed to say that in order to survive a battle you must
possess a clear image of your surroundings and the possible threats.
While your eyes are the two best devices for this, at times it is useful
to stop and listen for sounds of movement or enemy presence from a specific
direction. This skill teaches you not only to let yourself calm down and
listen, but to direct your attention to a specific direction as well.
Usage: use hear noises at <direction>
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Hew.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stats: Strength, Dexterity, Weapon Wielded, Hew Percentage,
  Hormanship Percentage, Mounted Attack Percentage and
  Charge Percentage.
This allows a mounted Paladin to make great sweeping attacks
with his sword. Skill in Horsemanship and Riposte will increase
the damage done. The Paladin MUST be wielding a sword to use
this skill.
NOTE: 1h swords strike more quickly, but do less damage.
 2h swords strike more slowly, but do more damage.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Holy might.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): str and wis
This skill grants the cleric with a great deal of extra strength
derived from the power of her god. A number of the cleric's
spells and skills, such as smash, gain effectiveness with the
more holy might the cleric has.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Horsemanship.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill measure the degree of control a Paladin has over
his mount. This skill contributes to the effectiveness of
mounted attack, mounted parry, mounted riposte, and mounted
combat.
NOTE: Controlling a mount is a rigorous activity, demanding
concentration. The dodge skill makes it very difficult to
maintain one's concentration and can spook the mount, reducing
the rider's overall level of control.

Help on skill: Hunting.
Usage duration: 1.
Skill type: neutral.
This skill allows the player to hunt some food to eat.
If you need to you can type abort to get out of the skill.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Hurl axes.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): various.
This powerful attack maneuver is the culmination of ranger's knowledge
in the axe weapons. With this skill, rangers of the deep forest can
hurl their axes at their enemies with lethal force, and actually have
the axes returned to them. This is only possible with the aid of a
magical enchantment, a spell called with the name 'balance axe' by its
inventor - a ranger, who got frustrated on losing his weapons to
enemies who survived his attack and fled with the axes.
The effectivess of this skill depends on the strength, dexterity and
ambidexterity of the ranger, relative size of the target, quality of the
weapons, as well as user's knowledge in axe fighting style, treecutting,
weapon skill, leftwield, axe mastery, spot weakness and bladed fury.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Ignore pain.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): con.
This technique allows the berserking fighter to ignore a larger portion of
the damage inflicted upon him. This means that the berserking fighter is
able to carry on fighting for much longer than he would be without this
ability. The damage will be felt later on, and that is when the lessons
in dealing with system shock and calming down come into question. Ignore
pain works in conjunction with Berserk.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Inner strength.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): con.
This skill represents the battle-hardiness of most types of warriors.
Vigorous training and long experience with stunning blows give the
ones most suitable for taking the blows an ability to resist or
lessen the stunning blows that they experience. The higher the
percentage of the skill, the greater the resistance.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Instrumentation.

Help on skill: Juggling.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): dex.
Through use of this skill, a bard is able to juggle several
specially summoned objects to entertain and please his
audience.  One of the major effects a juggling bard enjoys
is the ability to dodge several incoming area attacks, or at
least a portion thereof.  Another thing the bard may do is
to use the skill 'toss' to throw objects at his enemy with
great force.  The enemy, so distracted with watching the
bard juggle, is usually caught completely offguard.

brave and proudly. Nothing can't stop kamikaze samurai.
Samurais kamikaze will lead in the battle where only
one can survive.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:     Keen strikes
Usage duration:    automatic
Skill type:        special
Affecting stat(s): intelligence

By and large the spellblades hail from the ranks of spellcasters, be they mages, psionicists or sorcerers. While their magical talents may differ, they all share a desire to meld their magic with steel. Being originally primarily
spellcasters who shun melee combat, the first step in their goal was to bolster their presence in melee. To this end a rigorous training regime was devised, which sought to capitalize on the spellcaster's sharp mind and magic, augmenting his skills in all aspects of melee.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Ki.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
Often it is not wise to start a battle against an opponent who is fully
capable of defending itself. To give a monk an extra edge against a tough
enemy, he will often start the battle with a single attack combined with
a battle shout. This has the effect of startling and suprising the enemy,
while at the same time inflicting some damage. If correctly executed, this
technique will leave the target stunned and unable to fight back, so that
the monk and his party are able to inflict further damage without fear
for their own health. Also, by continuing his training, a monk who studies
the ability to focus this attack may be able to strike a second blow to the
enemy, dealing more damage and stunning them yet again.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Kick.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
Kicking is one of the most basic forms of attack, but that does not
mean it could be performed correctly without any practice. Other guilds,
especially the ones interested in magic, would probably find it amusing
that some spend time practicing how to extend their leg properly.
However, a properly placed kick can actually prove just as nasty as some
of the minor Offensive. spells. A fighter who wars and lives is a fighter
who knows the value of basic training.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Kiru.
Usage duration: 5
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, dex and weapon stats.
Samurai can put all his/her physical strength and dexterity in the
one single blow. They call this deadly skill for: 'KIRU'. Samurais
usually start battle with this skill. There are very few opponents
who survive that stunning and painful blow when performed by the most
impressive samurais. Using this skill and a sharp katana samurai
can be very dangerous opponent indeed.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Kungfu.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): dex and str.
Monks train in a number of powerful single attacks, which are much stronger
and more deadly than the normal routine of blows delivered in the course of
combat. The techniques together are called 'Kungfu', and form the most
important part of the combat skills of the monk. With this skill the monk
is able to make use of all of his amassed knowledge in the field of the
martial arts to strike his opponent. Because of this nature of Kungfu,
it is necessary to have knowledge in the simpler techniques to be able
to realize the full potential of the skill. Specifically, knowledge in
'fast blow', 'power kick', and 'mastery of kungfu' will increase the
damage done. Also, it is known that knowledge of 'focus kungfu attacks'
can allow the monk to strike critically with kungfu, and that knowledge
in the martial arts will increase the damage as well.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Leadership.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
Able leadership has always been the key ingredient in the mid of a successful
party. This skill will not only train you how to successfully lead and command
a party of people but it will also teach you with the principles of combat. A
potent leader trained thus is able to position his troops so that it becomes
possible to hit the enemy in his weakest point of defence. This skill affects
both your ability to lead, and being led in parties.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Leftwield.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Knowledge in this skill allows you to perform attacks with a weapon
in your left hand. It is possible to score up to three hits with your
left-wielded weapon if you are successful in the initial hit, doublehit
and the whirlwind attack. You are able to wield the weapon of your choice
in your left hand by typing: 'lwield <weapon name>'.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Legendary conjury.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): skill perfect, intelligence and dexterity.
The Magus Artiste are oft-times derided by the so-called professional
magic-users for their very narrow focus and their tendency to just "wing it"
when it comes to magic. There is no doubt however that a truly talented
Magus Artiste is able to perform incredible feats when it comes to wielding
projectile magics. Even if they themselves do not know how exactly it all
works.
A Magus Artiste performing 'legendary conjury' essentially compresses
a magical projectile by channeling a great amount of energy into and around
it. This will make the conjuration of the projectile take a little more time but
will make it more stable and easier to control, allowing the Artiste to aim
it with incredible accuracy. Depending on the Artiste's proficiency and natural
hand-eye coordination, a spell conjured in this manner can cause severe,
critical injuries--potentially causing havoc only dreamed of by the traditional
spellcasters. Such manipulation will however make the projectile less
devastating should the Artiste's aim be off.
Possessing knowledge of the opponent's anatomy will surely aid in aiming
the projectile into the most vital parts. A keen mind that is always on the
lookout for weaknesses in an opponent's defenses has also been found to
make a difference.
While the casting of projectile magics comes naturally to the Magus Artiste,
most have stated that it is even easier while performing the 'legendary conjury'.

Help on skill:     Loc ecsuram
Usage duration:    random
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): str, dex, skill knowledge and magus
Loc Ecsuram is the elven art of staff combat practiced by the
most skilled of elves from the dawn of the history of the race.
It is a form of combat performed by a single weapon wielded in
both hands, and more a matter of the mind than the body.
The Loc Ecsuram is in many way closest of all the elvish ways to the
Brotherhood of the Monks. Both rely on unlocking the inner power
of the combatant as well as turning the force of the opponent to
serve against themselves. Both consist of elements more profound
than simple martial arts. Furthermore, just like the art of
Kungfu, Loc Ecsuram can not be wholly learned by training alone.
Only after a life's experience of the Loc can the styles first
learned in the training grounds truly be perfected.
Once in the proper state of mind, the elf armed with a staff,
Loc in their language, will remain constantly alert to dangers,
and react should combat be initiated. This style of combat is as
much part of the elvish way of living for those elves who practice
it as the nature around them. It requires no effort to stay vigilant.
Certain parts of the Loc ecsuram can be performed without an opponent
present. This is because while Loc Ecsuram is a single unified way, it
contains several very different elements. Some, once learned, remain
always effective whenever in the proper state of mind while others
require conscious effort to perform. This skill teaches its practioner
the basics of combat with a Loc and allows him to use it to adopt the
proper state of mind required for other elements of the Loc Ecsuram.

Knowledge in this skill improves the power of enchant arrow spell while
enchanting arrows with greater magical preference.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Magus
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     Loc Ecsuram
Magus is the elven word for Magic. The force which exists in all
things and beings. Perhaps the most powerful, fundamental force
in the universe, Magus empowers you to overcome your limitations,
drawing upon the power of life. With this skill an elf trained in
the Loc Ecsuram can draw upon magic compensating for his physical
abilities. The magic will be woven into every attack you perform,
until its power is finally consumed. The more intelligent and wise
the elf, the more power he can contain at once and the smaller the
amount of Magus lost in transition. The Magus directed in this
manner truly becomes a part of its user, to the point that those
susceptible to it can even see an aura enveloping him. Because the
nature of Magus is inheriently offensive, those who are trained in
the art of offensive magic are far better in this than other elves.
Sorcerers, Mages, Clerics, Psionicists, Warlocks as well as the Druids
of Scathach receive training of this manner. The higher level in any
of these an Elf reaches, the greater the benefit. However, once having
learned the offensive art fully in a guild, levels in a second guild
provide no further addition of power. Not unless the training in
the first guild is still lacking or incomplete. This style of Loc
Ecsuram is complicated and requires specific concentration. You may
do this by typing 'magus' or 'magic' while focused in Loc Ecsuram.

Help on skill:     Mangle.
Usage duration:    random.
Skill type:        attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, con and dex.

With this skill the warrior is able to combine the benefits of using a shield
and a weapon of ancient class. Due to the complicated nature of ancient weapon
class the warrior is taught to perform the special attack with all the weapon
types of ancient's subcategories. This attack is of course heavily tied to
a shield. It cannot be executed without it. The damage of this skill depends
from user's attributes and somewhat of his knowledge of trained eye and bash.
It is also noteworthy that the speed of this skill depends heavily from the size
of the used weapon.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Martial arts.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
The basis of every monk's training is a number of techniques used primarily
in melee combat. These techniques, when considered together, are trained
by the monk as 'martial arts'. This covers all of these, as well as the
more fundamental aspects of fighting with the hands and feet rather than
with some weapon. This general knowledge of the martial arts is important
to every monk, regardless of his level of experience, and it is known to
affect the monk's ability to do damage with his Kungfu attacks.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Master tumbler.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
One skill practiced by many monks is that of tumbling to avoid some spells.
This is accomplished through careful study of the physical paths traveled
by those spells towards the monk, as well as of the movements necessary to
leave that path as quickly as possible. It is not an easy task to tumble
and avoid an incoming spell, made more difficult by the speed of the spell
and the sometimes unnatural position the monk is left in in the middle of
a fight. However, those who study exceptionally hard at mastering their
bodies and the techniques of tumbling are known to have a significant
advantage in this act. This skill describes that advanced knowledge in
the area of tumbling.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Mastery of healing trance.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
Though the use of a simple healing trance can be learned, even to a high
level of proficiency, by most monks, it is not correct to think that it
is a simple skill. Through training the mind in some of the finer points
of this technique, the monk is able to achieve a more potent trance, and
will heal faster while in it.

Help on skill: Mastery of kungfu.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
The skill Kungfu relies on knowledge of several simpler techniques.
However, this does not mean that these techniques are sufficient to
execute the Kungfu in the most powerful way. In fact, the more
difficult parts of the knowledge of Kungfu are numerous and important
enough that a monk must train himself in them separately. This skill
encompasses the knowledge learned by a monk to complete his training
in the techniques that are together known as Kungfu. This knowledge
will allow the monk to more accurately aim and time his Kungfus,
increasing the damage done.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Mutilation.
Usage duration: 1.
Skill type: Offensive.
Affecting stat(s): str, dex and con.
Mutilation is a general term for a group of skills that all have to do
with proficiency in the bludgeons weapon class. In order to successfully
mutilate a designated target, you must learn the different bludgeon
techniques that this skill takes advantage of.'Hammer' is the most important
one because all further studies base on the principles of hammering an enemy.
After you've chosen the target for the mutilating assault, the finer points
of different techniques come into play. Different techniques fit different
purposes and moments, and therefore it is important to know which technique
to rely on in a given situation. You control your offense by typing the name
of the technique you wish to employ when you are engaged in combat. Should
you not find a suitable opportunity for an advanced technique, or lack
knowledge in them, your attacks will consist of the basic, hammering blows.
Skill knowledge of the techniques used, knowledge in damage direction,
balancing of momentum, and the statistics of your person and your weapon all
affect the outcome of the battle. Outwit your opponent, and fear no man.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Mystifying flourish.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, dexterity and charisma.
The Magus Artiste have a lot in common with jesters and jugglers, more
so than they have with mages for example. There is a decidedly artistic
element present in all the magics of the Artiste, and for some reason it
also appears to be of great benefit.
When performing 'mystifying flourish' the Magus Artiste adds fancy gestures
and steps, even dance-like routines, to his spellcasting. Either this
prancing about truly does make the spells stronger or the on-lookers are
just so bewildered by it, that they are caught completely unawares by the
destructive projectiles. Either way, the agility and the charisma of the
Magus Artiste will now play a greater role in the effectiveness of the spells.
While a spell magnified in this manner does not drain additional magical
energy, the flourishing is slightly fatiguing in the long run. In most
cases the magical drain have actually been found to be lessened, suggesting
that there actually might be something real in these strange methods--
some wonder that essentially allows a Magus Artiste to convert physical energy,
stamina, into magical energy to fuel their spells.
A Magus Artiste who is especially talented and charismatic is often
able to hide the initiated spellcasting, though not by concealing it like
the psionicists do but rather disguising it with artistic embellishments
into something entirely harmless.

With this powerful ability, a skilled bard is able to talk an
enemy down from combat. The bard actually launches into a
lengthy tirade about the values of peace over war and how

the bard can randomly remove herself from combat with an
enemy, while the rest of her party is still fighting.

Help on skill: Overhead swing.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
Often considered mere bashing by the users of more 'civilized' weapons, this
bludgeon technique seems easier to perform than it really is. The ability to
judge the right moment to open up your defense by raising your weapon far
above your head is something that only comes with practice. This form of
an attack is suitable for occasions when the opponent is either just raising
his defenses or is guarding his upper torso badly. Should the powerful bash
hit the head of the opponent, a single strike could prove lethal.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Parry.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: defensive.
The master of this skill is able to parry, and thus avoid, hits in combat.
Experienced fighters and paladins are often able to follow up their parry
with a riposte if they so choose. Parrying and dodging are the two most basic
means of avoiding damage in hand-to-hand combat, and most fighter type guilds
are proficient in either one or both of them. Dodge and parry together form
the defensive. value that is displayed when you toggle your parry setting.
This value is also affected by the weight you are carrying. It is to be
noted however, that when concentrating on parrying hits, your ability to
perform attacks of your own drops. It is possible to alternate the amount
of concentration towards parrying by typing: 'parry <0-51>'.
this will directly reflect to the values of both your Attack and
Parry skill. Parrying is more efficient with a shield.

Affecting stat(s): skill percent, dexterity and intelligence.
The offense of a Magus Artiste almost solely relies on deadly accuracy,
rather than massive discharges of energy. In the hands of a talented Artiste
this approach is both devastating and economical. Such precision would not
be worth much, however, if one could not adapt. This is where the practices
of 'pinpoint aim' come into play. By taking a little more time in conjuring
the magic, a trained Magus Artiste is able to concentrate the projectiles
more accurately and with an intent that suits the current situation better--
be it a need to cause more devastating injuries, or to dazzle or to stun the
opponent.

enchanting arrows with lesser poison preference.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Pon arila
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     Loc Ecsuram
Pon Arila is the elven word for Perception. A profound awareness
of your surroundings and changes. Elendien are by their nature
connected to the world with deeper ties than most other creatures.
Their long life and profound affection for the nature cause them
to experience the state of the world in persona. While this ability
is the natural way of any elf, harvesting its power in combat
requires an adjustment in thinking, which this skill represents.
After such an adjustment is made, the trainee becomes aware of his
surroundings to a point nearing precognition of events. The defensive
capabilities this bestows are very significant. Due to the nature of
this style it is always in use as long as the Loc Ecsuram is
performed.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Pon deila
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     Loc Ecsuram
Pon Deila means Harmony and Continuity in nature in the elven tongue.
In elven staff fighting it significes a method of combat taught
to grace the movements of an elf with a natural rythm. This makes
the transition from an offensive movement to an other faster and allows
for more powerful blows upon occasion if the practioner of Loc Ecsuram.
manages to move in perfect harmony with his Loc. Due to the nature of
this style it is always in use as long as the Loc Ecsuram is performed.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Power kick.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
When a young monk is first learning to fight with his hands and feet, it is
natural to learn the simpler, faster blows delivered with the hands first.
However, the monks do not neglect the increased power that can be delivered
using the larger muscles of the legs and stronger surfaces of the feet. By
taking advantage of this and making a powerful kick at the enemy, even a
young monk is capable of dealing significant damage.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Pra evaleo
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     Loc Ecsuram
Pra Evaleo is the elven word for Power. The staff fighting style
designed to subdue the opponent was named after it. These attacks
are performed simultaneously with those of Volo but due to the strain
their performance causes and the opportunities they require to succeed,
appear more infrequently. In the art of Loc Ecsuram the Volo is used to
injure and distract the opponent until a suitable opportunity presents
itself, which is then pressed with Pra Evaleo. This style of Loc Ecsuram
is complicated and requires specific concentration. You may do this
by typing 'pra evaleo' or 'power' while focused in Loc Ecsuram.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Prayer.
Usage duration: 4.
Skill type: heal.
Affecting stat(s): wis.
This skill will revive a dead player, it has
the same effects as praying in the church.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Prepare corpse.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): skill knowledge and undead surgery.
When an advanced necromancer, one acquainted with the latest developments
in the field of scientific necromancy, wishes to create an undead, this skill
will be necessary. Traditional undead only require a corpse for reanimation,
but undead creatures animated with the scientific method, such as the
Frankenstein, require custom bodyparts. Upon successful use, this skill will
produce enough raw material for the creation of one such bodypart.
The efficiency of this skill is based on knowledge of this skill and
knowledge of the skill 'undead surgery'.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Prepare potion.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
This skill allows you to prepare an empty potion.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Prev enire
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     Loc Ecsuram
Prev Enire is the elven word for Reaction. In staff fighting, it
signifies the way of matching the move of your opponent with an
equal one of your own, timed seamlessly to fit that of your foe.
An attack aimed to kill often leaves its performer prone to an
instant counter-attack, because its performer does not expect the
other to be alive to make one. Coupled with Pon Arila this gives
an elf trained with the Loc the means to strike back while bracing
to accept the incoming attack. This style of Loc Ecsuram is
complicated and requires specific concentration. You may do this
by typing 'prev enire' or 'reaction' while focused in Loc Ecsuram.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Protected blade.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type:     special.

This skill finishes the training the fighter started by training dancing
blade. Alone both of these skills offer only partial knowledge and
a warrior without either of these skills is incomplete. Knowledge in this
skill adds to the knowledge of basics techniques, honing those towards
perfection. With the full knowledge of this skill and the basic techniques
the fighter's sword may truly dance.

Knowledge in this skill speeds up aiming a ranged weapon.
This skill is automatically in use.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Rage.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): str.
One of the key lessons in berserking is the way a fighter can use his
enraged mood to bolster his physical strength. All anger affects the
body to some extent, yet to fully harvest that advantage in combat and
not waste it by concentrating on the fear for your own life is a skill
of its own. The higher you are skilled in this particular lesson of
of the barbarian art, the more strength you will gain by berserking.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Randomize preference.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): int.
For a Spell weaver, this skill is usually the first cross-over
from sheer physical manipulation of the space around him to
actually mastering the arts of creating destruction at will.
Manipulation of the chosen target's very own body by turning
needed saps and blood in to streams of acid and death is an
impressive feat, even if Random. at first.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:  Ranged tactics.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type:     special.

Fighting with a shield and a polearm combination is demanding activity due to
the fact that the handling of a long weapon is not easy when your other hand
is tied to a shield and you have to execute the attacks with one hand. Even
a fool can charge into a combat with an armament like this but it is more than
likely that the fool will meet his maker rather swiftly, without the knowledge
of what to do with his weapon. The knowledge in this skill helps the warrior
to use his shield and polearm more efficiently. The warrior will learn how and
where to strike and how to maintain his alertness level through the battle.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Recitation.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): int and cha.
Through skillful use of this ability, a bard can turn a boring,
run of the mill song into an exciting tale enjoyable for all
who watch and listen. Training this skill also allows the bard
to compose and create more songs and add a bit more variance to
his or her performances.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Rectitude.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill reduces the randomness of the damage caused
by Inquisitor spells.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Remove elements.
Usage duration: 15.
Mental Cost: 100 SPs.
Skill type: neutral.
When a monk successfully summons the nearby elemental energies and focuses
them into his knuckles, he retains some small amount of control over these
forces. For this reason, it is a simpler task for the monk to dispel the
elements surrounding his knuckles than it is to summon them in the first
place, taking far less mental energy. Since the monks are taught from an
early age that these forces are beneficial, and in fact almost necessary,
this skill is most often used so that the monk can call a different
element into his knuckles.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Rescue.
Usage duration: 1.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): dex.
This rather delicate technique is used for fighters with long experience
in fighting together as a group. Before entering a potentially dangerous
fight the leader and the potential rescuer agree on the level of damage
the leader will sustain before the rescuer steps to the front. Then as
the field of battle is reached the change of the person taking the
hits will automatically take place if the need occurs. A pact of rescuing,
once made, lasts until the warparty ends, or the rescuing takes place.
Usage: rescuer: use rescue at <leader>, leader: set wimpy to desired amnt.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Retort.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Along with other very offensive manouvers generated a long time ago,
this technique was also discovered. A cunning warrior, in a combat
trance, can use momentum of the opponents foolish hit by avoiding it
and turning that into a revengeful blow. Not full strength of the
opponents hit have been learned to be used but still considerable
amount of that strength is used.
Like mentioned above, amounts of suffering enemy will take from these
moves are totally dependant from strength of the enemys hit.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Righteousness.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill allows an Inquisitor to draw strength from his
conviction that Evil must be destroyed at all costs.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Riposte.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Riposting means performing an immediate counter-attack after a successful
parry. The amount of parried hits depends on your current defence factor
which is modified by many things, such as weight and skill percents.
You are able to riposte as many hits as you manage to parry, and
since some creatures can hit you quite often this can add to a great
amount of damage over time. Due to the quickness of the ripostes the
actual damage of one hit is quite low, although it can be augmented
with the skill Enhanced riposte.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Saturn lore.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill a measure of a Druids ability to take advantage of
the atronomical conjunctions of the planet Saturn.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Scattershot.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent and dexterity.
The Magus Artiste are known first and foremost for their incredible
accuracy and agility with projectile spells. But anyone who is expecting
an Artiste to always take their time and carefully aim each shot, is likely
to be unpleasantly surprised. When forgoing most of the time-consuming aiming
an Artiste is able to focus all their considerable talents into conjuring the
magics as quickly as possible, thus creating an overwhelming barrage of
projectiles. Needless to say, the accuracy of each shot is greatly reduced.
The energy of the projectiles is also lessened as the Artiste does not spend
as much time channeling the magic.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Sense weakness.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automagic
With this skill Sorcerers can sense
the weaknesses of their targets and
focus their death wish at it.
It is automatically in use.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Sensory overload
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Spell weaver skill.
Affecting stat(s): int
Spell weavers properly trained in this technique will
occasionally succeed in augmenting the audio-visual part of
their binded magics to such proportions that it will momentarily
distract their enemy as their senses are overwhelmed.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Shield fighting.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill allows a Paladin to use his shield effectively
in combat. It is automatically in effect, but you must
log out and back in after first training it in order for
it to take effect.
Note: At higher levels of mastery, this skill can
momentarily stun an opponent.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Shielding control.

Help on skill: Shielding efficiency.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Spell weaver skill.
Affecting stat(s): wis.
Shielding efficiency is an invaluable sum of the tricks
of trade of the past Spell weaver generations, saving the little
ways used to make shielding somewhat easier for the caster.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Shielding of death.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automatic.
Protective spells are fundamentally slightly incompatible with the traditional
mindset of necromancers. Because of this difference, it requires somewhat
additional effort for necromancers to be able to protect their minions
effectively. This skill represents deeper understanding and training in the
ways of protection for the uses of necromancy.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Skill that saves sp.
Usage duration: automatic.

Help on skill: Slash.
Usage duration: Random.

in the skills strike and bladed fury will increase the damage.
You must be wielding a sword to use this skill.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Smash.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
With this powerful skill a cleric may bludgeon a hated enemy to
death with several powerful blows from either a bludgeoning
weapon or a staff. The damage performed depends on the cleric's
strength and weapon power. Enraged priests are known to do
a bit more damage with this skill as well. The true power of
smash, however, lies in the priest's ability to deal multiple
attacks, causing much more damage than normal. These attacks
have been known to rarely interrupt the target's concentration
or even stun them completely. The number of extra attacks is
related to the priest's wisdom, weapon skills and the amount
of holy might they can channel, while to the damage of each
extra attack directly relates to the priest's faith.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Spacial manipulation.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill helps you create spells dealing with spacial
manipulations. The higher this skill is trained the more effective
these types of spells will be.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Specify part.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): skill knowledge and undead surgery.
With this skill a necromancer can mold the unspecialized chunk of flesh
created with the 'prepare corpse'-skill to actually make a bodypart suitable
for use in the creation of advanced undead, such as the Frankenstein.
The effectiveness of this skill is dependent on the knowledge of this skill
and the skill 'undead surgery'.
Usage: use specify part at <hand/head/leg/torso>
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Spinning patterns.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
This rather odd technique is seldom used in actual combat, but due
to its efficiency in physically straining its user, this technique
is still taught to the initiates of the guild. The principle of
the technique is to accelerate the movement of the bludgeons as
quickly and strongly as possible, ignoring the strain it causes
to the user. The fatigue created in the act of whirling is the
very reason the guild has abandoned it as a useful technique
for gathering momentum.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Spiritism.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automatic.
The act of channelling energies through a spirit is far from simple,
and this skill is vital for maximal efficiency when transferring mental
energy to a called spirit. This skill also affects the efficiency of the
actual blast of negative energy from the spirit.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Spiritual link.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automatic.
Called spirits are almost incomprehensible creatures even for necromancers,
who are accustomed to dealing with beings originated from the negative energy
plane. Therefore a necromancer will benefit greatly from being more attuned to
the negative energy plane and gains the ability to transmit commands much
faster over the spiritual link to his called spirit.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Split corpse.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
Sometimes it is necessary for a necromancer to split a large corpse that
contains much power into two smaller ones, and this skill will allow it.
This messy and gory act, is actually a bit more complicated than just sawing
a corpse into pieces, as the power it contains has to be carefully guarded to
prevent it from escaping. The exact weight ratio of the produced remains
depends highly on the user's knowledge of this skill.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Spot weakness.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Knowledge in this skill allows you to see an opening in the defence of
your enemy when using the skill Slash, Whirlwind slash and Hurl axes,

Usage duration: automatic.

improves your hit chance. It also allows you to continue aiming or
loading after you get hit.

Skill type: neutral.
This skill produces a summary of the number and strength
conjunctions that will occur during the next 24 mud hours.
It doesn't produce details, only a summary.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Strike.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str, dex, weapon stats and skill knowledge.
Before a fighter is able to learn the finer points of techniques used in
various Offensive. maneuvers, it is crucial to learn to pack some force
behind the attacks. Striking is the most basic way of assaulting a target
with a melee-weapon. Since striking is a relatively simple way of attacking
an enemy, it can be easily misjudged as inefficient. This is partially
true, the finer techniques make better use of the special. properties of
their own specific weapon types, but they are also limited to those types
of weapons only. Striking works well in conjunction with any weapon type.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Strike mighty blow.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
Named by the previous groups of initiate maulers, this skill orginates from
the vigorous exercises performed in order to augment the momentary strength
of a soldier. The idea of these exercises is to strengthen the fighter so
that he may, when needed to, gather all his strength behind one single maul.
This is a rather desperate tactic, since such a blow usually uses up the
fighter's reserves of power and there is a risk of the maul getting stuck.
Most maulers choose to use it as a last minute option to end a prolonged
fight with one mighty blow from a warhammer.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Stun.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): str.
Any enemy a warrior might encounter, no matter how highly skilled, will
occasionally make mistakes in their defense, as will the warrior.
It is often said that the victor of the battle is the one who took
the most advantage from the other's errors. Critical and stunning
blows appear during these moments of the opponent's error, and
can easily tip the scale for the stunner's benefit. Stunned
enemies can not fight, flee, or avoid hits. Knowledge in
this skill increases the chance of stunning and the
duration of a successful stun.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Stunning blow.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): int.

to a weapon in the combat weapon belt. It is a bit harder but not
impossible while fighting.
Syntax: use 'switch weapon' <weapon 1> <weapon2>
or use 'switch weapon' <weapon 1> to <weapon2>
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: System shock.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
A berserking fighter is able to ignore the pain and damage he suffers
due to his enraged mood, but this advantage is only temporary.
Should the fighter remain alive long enough, the rage will
wear off and the pain will be felt. Highly experienced fighters
are able to ignore amounts of damage sufficient to instantly kill
a lesser person, and therefore it is vital to be able to deal with
the shock that follows calming down. The fighters skilled in system
shock will suffer a smaller portion of the damage ignored, and if
lucky, they can sometimes survive even if the damage felt exceeds
their current stamina.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Tameshivar.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Taunt.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: combat.
A skilled bard always keeps a repitoire of insults and abuse
handy, learned from her time travelling the world.  A bard
can use these insults to enrage an enemy, causing them to
loose much in the way of defense power, but angering them
enough that they deal a great deal more damage in combat.
The taunt will last until the monster or bard are dead,
or the bard leaves the room.

skill percents in throw and mastery skill. Throwing speed
highly depens on your dexterity and mastery skill as well.

You have to use your mighty tessen with this skill.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Throw sand.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
Throwing sand in the eyes of your opponent is one of the less fair ways
to fight your duels, but in common warfare anything that keeps your
head on your shoulders goes. A successful throw can blind the
opponent and therefore allow the fighter to make a strategic
withdrawal if it's judged to be needed. The sand suitable for this
type of an attack can only be found outdoors.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Tinning.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
This skill supplies the knowledge required for the proper use of the
tinning kit. It takes some doing to learn to use the kit properly,
without this skill you would probably just make a mess of the ingredients.
To tin the dead body of a creature you consider edible you need this skill
and a functional tinning kit. The Tinker of Zombiecity is renowned for his
ability to construct the most reliable of tinning kits in all the realm.

Help on skill: Tormentation.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
The trainers of the Fighters' Guild have taken the habbit of denying the
existance of this entire technique due to its unpopular affects to the
'honor' of warfare. It is well known within the ranks of the mauler that
this technique is taught regardless due to its efficiency when used properly.
The name 'Tormentation' describes the purpose of this technique rather
well, the main purpose of the technique is to inflict pain upon an opponent,
making it hard for him to concentrate on anything except the pain.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Toss.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Attack.
Affecting stat(s): str and dex.
A juggling skill that allows the bard to throw one of the

Some rangers have honed their skills in treecutting to such extent that
they are able to use an axe to make a very fast horizontal sweep targeted
at the opponenents legs as if cutting down a tree. This skill works better
at large opponents and you have to use an axe.

Help on skill: Tumble.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: neutral.
Of the attack spells currently known to the spellcasting guilds of the realm,
a great number are released from the caster's body and travel in a physical path
towards the intended victim. When this is true, and depending upon the spell,
it may be possible for someone to tumble and avoid the spell entirely. This of
course requires extensive training, and even then is a risky thing to rely on,
since these spells are designed to hit the target, not to be avoided.

Help on skill: Undead surgery.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
Affecting stat(s): skill knowledge and unholy ceremony and size of corpse.
Undead beings, owing to the fact that they are actually dead, do not
regenerate and heal like living beings do. Because of this drawback,
necromancers are forced to resort to other means to keep their minions
in good enough shape to fight. Because magical healing is rather inefficient
and is not really an area where necromancers are very proficient, a more
mundane, but very efficient method of healing has been devised.
This gruesome and disgusting technique is used to sew a damaged undead back
to working shape by using parts from another corpse. However, it is not
possible to repair all of the damage the undead has sustained with this skill.
The size of the used corpse also affects the maximum possible healing done
with this skill.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Unholy ceremony.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automatic.
When dealing with advanced concepts of necromancy, such as spiritism and

understanding of such gruesome rituals and allows better efficiency and
higher power to be attained.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Unholy surgery.
Usage duration: 5.
Skill type: neutral.
The art of necromancy is age-old, and has been practised by numerous different
necromancers during the course of history. All that time has certainly not
been wasted, and necromancy is undergoing a strong change at this very moment.
Until recently, necromantic rituals have traditionally been very magical in
their nature. Most commonly, animation of dead corpses with negative energy
channeled directly from its native plane. The newest and most advanced addition
is the so-called scientific necromancy, which aims to produce undead creatures
in a very different manner, with little or no magic involved at all.
This particular skill is used to connect the specially crafted bodyparts of an
undead known as a 'Frankenstein' to each other. This skill also requires
additional connecting material in the form of raw corpses.

Help on skill:  Volo
Usage duration: automatic
Skill type:     Loc Ecsuram
Volo is the elven word for Speed. The quick, less powerful
staff fighting technique is understood through this word. Knowledge
in Volo will make the melee attacks that are performed simultaneously
with those of Pra Evaleo more powerful. Even though of low power, these
attacks will injure and distract the opponent until a moment suitable for
the final blow presents itself. Due to the nature of this style it is
always in use as long as the Loc Ecsuram is performed.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:     Wall of steel.
Usage duration:    random.
Skill type:        defensive.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, masteries and dex.

This skill teaches the warrior a way to use his shield on a skill level from
which untrained people can only dream of. He will be taught how to calculate
the landing areas of melee and missile attacks, and how to block them without
an extra effort, all the way to the point where performing a block turns into
almost instinctual activity. After the training the shield will no longer be
a part of his armament but a part of him, a proverbial steel wall that stands
between him and his foes. It is said that true masters of this skill have
dared to challenge even sorcerers and other magicians of great power, walking
out from those duels with only few fried hair. The success ratio of this skill
depends on user's knowledge of this skill, his shield related fighter
masteries and dexterity.

---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Whirling maces.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: Bludgeon fighting technique.
The deadliest of bludgeons cause devastating damage because of several key
factors. Magical properties, crudely placed spikes and raw force all help, but
the most important factor is the momentum of the maul. The greater velocity
the greater damage upon impact. This technique instructs its master to whirl
his maces in the fashion that besides dealing blows, the maces also pick up
speed. The whirling effect however makes this technique quite inaccurate, and
damage caused by it is often Random. and badly placed even if impressive.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Whirlwind attack.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Whirlwind attacks are hit combinations that base themselves upon using
the momentum of the wielded weapon. A standard Offensive. from a fighter
begins with an attack, instantly followed by a doublehit to approximately
the same area, and then the whirlwind attack is executed. This happens
by applying leverage to the weapon, swinging it quickly around, and
striking yet another hit. There are as many techniques to perform
a whirlwind attack as there are warriors proficient in it, but the
quick pull after a hit is the key element. Whirlwind attack can be
successful only after a doublehit, and it is possible to execute it
with either or both hands. Therefore a skilled warrior can hit up to
six times, although some of the Warlords have been seen performing
combinations with even more attacks in them.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Whirlwind slash.
Usage duration: Random.
Skill type: attack.
Affecting stat(s): dex and str.
The skilled fighters and rangers who have chosen blades as their preferred
weapon sometimes execute whirling slashes that wound multiple opponents at
once. The principle of this weapon technique is to engage the intended
targets in melee-combat, drawing them close enough for the blade's reach,
and then launching a series of slashes and cuts at the entire mass of
enemies. Although any given one of the wounds inflicted will most likely
prove far inferior to those a blademaster can inflict with a targeted slash,
with weak or injured enemies this display of swordmanship can take out
several foes at once. This technique is popularly used for executing the
hostile, yet inadept, peasants.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill:     Wild strike
Usage duration:    random
Fatigue:           high
Skill type:        attack
Affecting stat(s): strength, dexterity, intelligence, attack, weapon skill, anatomy and spot weakness

The typical spellblade is far from a martial master, relying on magic to gain the upper hand. As such, their training in melee techniques leave much room for improvement. This one in particular is a most basic attack, executed quickly
and usually with a distinct lack of skill. But it is often heavily augmented with magic, making the attack something to be wary of.
This attack can only be executed with daggers, swords, polearms, or bladed or piercing ancients.

Help on skill: Willpower.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: automagic.
Necromancers are usually physically weak beings, and depend on their mindless
undead minions in fighting battles for them. The method of controlling such
undead requires considerable effort, and this skill represents rigorous
training in such activity. The stronger a necromancer's will is, the less he
will need to exert himself when commanding his minions.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on skill: Wondrous legerdemain.
Usage duration: automatic.
Skill type: special.
Affecting stat(s): skill percent, dexterity, charisma and intelligence.
One might be impressed to see a bard juggling several wickedly sharp axes,
but when one witnesses a Magus Artiste doing the same with firebolts one has
a reason to be truly awed.
While the actual juggling of projectiles is beyond most, each Artiste with
at least some training in the "wondrous legerdemain" is able to counter
hostile projectile magics to a great degree. This talent employs almost
dance-like routines not only for avoiding the projectile but gaining limited
control over it. By expending a slight amount of magical energy, the Artiste
can alter the course of the bolt and potentially launch it back towards its
original caster. As the skill of the Artiste increases they are actually
able to suspend the bolt almost indefinitely by keeping the projectile in
motion but constantly influencing its course, making it appears as if they
were juggling with it. These projectiles can then be thrown at will at a
target.
Being trained in the arts of acrobacy and traditional juggling have been
found to be of benefit.
