Cinedi (pl. Cined)

"The Travelers"

  An ancient race that disappeared from the realm aeons ago, fading first into
legends until not even the elves remembered the name. Their contribution,
however, lived on: the Navigators and their great obelisks.

  The Cined are tall humanoids, typically with a platinum-coloured skin with
random patches of black and purple all over the body, especially around the
shoulders and the back. They are of lean build, their arms and legs long and
thin, as are their seven fingers. The head atop the thin neck is pronouncedly
egg-shaped, and almost comically high. From the top of the head descends a
sharp ridge of bone between the three pairs of eyes, and down to the tip of
the wide, flat nose. The ears are small and slightly pointed.

  They possess a natural curiosity that pushes them to seek new experiences,
new locations and peoples. This proclivity ultimately lead to the founding
of the guild of Navigators, as they found the constant traveling from place
to place to be exceedingly cumbersome. In this era, the pursuits of the Cined
are not as such about find new places, but finding new ways of getting there.

  The Cined have a tendency to mull over their actions, considering all the
perceivable outcomes and the different points of view. Due to this they may,
sometimes, appear slow and even dim-witted. While it is true that they are
not in general the brighest minds of the realm, the ponderous approach has
gifted them with great wisdom.

  Along with the aptitude of dimensional manipulation, the Cined have a natural
affinity to magic. Not magic as spells, but Magic as a primeval force of the
universe. The Cined are able to possess great amounts of magical energy, far
more than most other magic users of the realm. This proverbial horn of plenty
has a drawback, though, as their spells tend to expend slightly more energy.
Some of them have also discovered ways of enhancing the destructive spells
that utilize magic in its purest form, while some have developed natural
resistance to the very same force.

 Cromagnons are living relics from the early dawn of humanity.  They are

Most devils are somewhat larger than humans and have a thick, red skin and
a pair of horns. They feed upon the dead, and carry within themselves the
ability to develop beyond their natural potential. Some even grow wings or
a tail.

Originally these creatures from the lower planes of Hell were created to
serve as officers and commanders in the army of Lucifer, the fallen son of
Silvain. Blessed with intelligence superior to the other servants of the
Archangel, such as the fiend and the damned, yet bound to the same hatred
of good, they were ideally suited to the task. Devoid of free will, these
creatures were seen in the realms only if sent by their Master or summoned
by a spellcaster of great power. 

This changed the day the Paladins assaulted the only known breach between Hell
and these realms. Forced to surface with elements of His Army, Lucifer was 
momentarily disposed and unable to control his minions. Lead by the greatest
of them, General Shrije, a group of devils managed to break free and escape.
This signaled the beginning of a free race of devils. No longer bound to do
their Master's bidding, they set out to the worlds, seeking their destiny.

Resembling humans in many ways, and differing from them in just as
many, the dwarves are a quite common sight around the world. A dwarf
looks like a short and very stocky human, rarely taller than four
feet, but usually heavier than the biggest humans. The heavy beard
growth among the male dwarves is also a distinguishing feature
associated with the race. Most dwarves live in the dwarven kingdom,
stretching out around the underground dwarven capital, which is
called 'Uhruul' among the dwarves themselves. They live in clan
societies that are quite similar to big families, sometimes
consisting of hundreds or even thousands of brethren. Dwarves are
known for their abilities within craftsmanship and engineering. The
ease with which they adopt new techniques together with their
strength and endurance make them among the most feared warriors known
in the realm. When it comes to magic, everyone including the dwarves
themselves, will agree on the fact that dwarves are no magicians. Some
have a miniscule knowledge of a few spells, but most dwarves have no
clue about spellcasting at all, and look at magic with suspicion.

In the dwarven armies, one weapon is more common than any other, the
war-axe. It is so common that some people believe that dwarves are
born with the knowledge of how to use an axe. The ones with better
insight in the dwarven community know that this is not the case
though. The truth is that dwarves just like any other race needs
lots of practice before mastering the art of axe-fighting, but that
so many of them chose to do so that it might look like the entire
race possesses the knowledge.

Revered by many for their apparent ease at spellcraft, and known for the
grace which is common amongst all their kin, the elves of the land hail from
the ancient forest of Eliendien on the Elven Isles far across the Great Ocean.
They are known amongst their own blood as the Magudien; the magic weavers.

They are lithe and beautiful, as all elves are, and their upswept ears are
the hallmark of their kind. They are slow to age, and even those who have
lived for centuries seem young in the eyes of most other races which travel
these lands. The constant handling of magic has left its mark upon these true
elves, for their features are often highlighted with a hint of opalescence; a
bright sheen to their extremely fair skin and hair which resembles the kiss
of dew on the soft petals of a rose. The touch of magic itself.

Delving into the natural flow of energies which binds the world with an ease
that comes only to those races born to it, they have grown so close to the
magic that they are said to know their own places within the great scheme
of the world better than any other being to walk within the realm. If any
creatures apart from the Gods themselves know their parts in the Grande Play
of the World as it rolls ever onward, then it is surely the Magudien elves.

The fell wight is an undead horror of immense power brought to being by the dark
touch of Mordiggian himself. They are said to herald the coming of everlasting
winter, a time of ice and decay. The fell wight is a cousin of a wight - if such
a term can be said to apply in the relations of the undead - in that their
respective origins are ultimately the same. But what sets them apart is their
power, as whereas a common wight may possess great skill with weapons, the fell
wight is not only a martial adept but also highly capable wielder of the arcane.

The visage of a fell wight is a terrifying one: white skin, scarred and rigid,
stretched tight around its gaunt frame, and eyes that blaze with malevolent blue
fire. And always a thin shroud of frost around the creature - a blizzard waiting
to happen.

There have been vague stories of these creatures being encountered upon the
glacier of Despair, but whether these stories are true and whether their alleged
presence relates to nothing but the proximity of the Castle Greenlight is
anyone's guess. Regardless, there have been some stirrings among the ranks of

Ghasts could be said to be cousins of ghouls, something that is supported by the
similarity of appearance between the two. A ghast has the same starved body and
the pallid flesh and the long, sharp teeth. Their eyes however glow bright
green.

Like ghouls, ghasts are carrion-eaters, frequently encountered at graveyards and
crypts. They are often in a position of leadership among a group of ghouls. A
ghast is formidable opponent, for it is both cunning and highly agile. Ghasts
have a propensity for both stealth and magic, making them even more dangerous.
It is said that the touch of a ghast can paralyze the living.

Like all undead a ghast is naturally not only resistant to poisons and diseases

Some legends say ghouls are cannibals cursed to live on as living dead and while
this might be actually true, most of them are people who were infected by the
diseased bite of a ghoul or a ghast, and subsequently died to the ailment to
rise as a carrion-eating ghoul.

The typical ghoul is a foul monster of low intelligence barely capable of
rational thought or speech, scavenging graveyears and crypts in search of the
next meal. Some ghouls, however, manage to hold on to their intellect and
personality from their life before and can actually be quite civilized, and
could pass as ordinary people if it weren't for their appearance. A ghoul
appears as a humanoid, its pallid flesh stretched tightly over its starved
frame, a mouth full of long, sharp teeth and its eyes completely black.

Like all undead they are naturally resistant to poisons and diseases but are
not as susceptible to magical forces as others of the living dead.

While still part of the dwarven race, gnomes are not that similar to
their relatives except in length. The average gnome stands about
four feet tall and has the same build as a human. Their heads are
proportionally bigger though and their eyes are larger, rounder and
have much brighter colours. It is common among the gnomes to take a
big interest in gems, jewels and anything that shines or sparkles.
This is very visible in the gnomish fashion, which exhibits colourful
dresses and tunics, embellished with ornaments made of rare stones
and metals.

Gnomes commonly earn their money in scholarly professions, but there
are also gnomes who work in traditional dwarven trades, such as
mining, where they make up for their physical weaknesses by using
magical powers. This is also where the gnomes differ most from their
underworld neighbours. While it is rare to find a dwarf who knows
how to cast a spell, it is even more rare to find a gnome who has
no clue about magic at all.

The gnome society is very loosely organized. Mostly due to the fact
that whichever event shaped them as they are now, also effectively
separated them from the rest of the dwarven community. While their
largest settlement is located in the dwarven capital Uhruul, gnomes
do not swear fealty to the Dwarven King. Yet gnomes remain tightly
allied with other dwarves, and the most prominent of them serves as
the spiritual advisor for the Dwarven King.

Gnomes are known for their devotion and their faith in the gods.
They feel, some say that they know, that their life is closely tied
to the whim of the celestial beings, which makes it much easier for
them to overcome their doubts and just believe in their faith. This
devotion comes at a price though. Caring so much and trying so hard
makes it harder on them when their faith turns out to be wrong, when
they fail, or have to give up.

Noble in spirit and full of grace, the High Elves of the land move with an
assured stride seen only in those who have lived long enough to have learned
the true lessons of the world. Poised and rational by nature, they are
uncommonly wise, not beyond their years, but because of them. Each day of
their youth spent in lesson and selfless nurturing of their own kind, now
brought to fruitition in an ascended elven status as a Valeodien, for no elf
may be born High. Real wisdom is hard earned.

And yet their lessons do not end there, as no lesson should. The Valeodien
are the Lorekeepers of the realm. It is said that they may learn the Tales
of the World, and later recite them so that what has gone before is not
forgotten. Their voices are powerful, and it is said that their enunciation
fortifies all knowledge. To hear a Valeodien speak is to know the world as
it was meant to be, and to know each of our own places within it.

Longest lived of the races, they age very slowly, even when compared to other
elves. They are tall, and delicate in appearance, and yet strong from within.
They are charismatic folk, and while they are great users of magic, they shun
the use of chaotic, psionic or purely destructive magic.

Bonded to their homeland in a manner far more intricate than that of their
other elven kin, the Valeodien live and breathe the seasons themselves. The
cold touch of Colus, the warm breezes of Tauri, each in turn has a personal
effect on a High Elf, and that effect is most easily seen upon those which
have utilized their innate ability to learn beyond normal learning. They are
Those who through introspection have found the key with which to unlock their
own souls from the bonds of normal maximums and mortal limitations.

 Halflings are a hard-working race of peaceful citizens.  Their communities
 are similar to those of humans, although they usually contain many burrow
 homes in addition to surface cottages.  Halflings average three and a half

Highland dwarves are distant cousins to the regular dwarves. They
abandoned the mines and caves centuries ago, choosing to live off
hunting and what the forests can give rather than mining and
craftsmanship. The life outside of the tunnels have made them bigger
than their relatives from the underworld, giving the average clansman
a height of nearly five feet. The highland dwarves have kept the
dwarven proportions though, which with the increased height gives
them an impressive muscle mass to say the least. The usually red
haired or blond woodsmen have kept the dwarven social structure,
and live in big village clans, far up in the highlands of the
dwarven kingdom.

Being part of the dwarven kingdom, and loyal to the king, the
highland dwarves train to be a part of the dwarven armies if need
be. Just as their kinsmen from Uhruul, they learn the dwarven art
of axe fighting.

Highland dwarves are extremely conservative and stubborn in their
thinking. Getting a clansman from the highlands to understand new
ideas or new approaches to complete a task is therefore very hard.
Such a simple thing as a logical explanation or an inspiring song is
certainly not going to change his beliefs. As if this was not enough,
they have an old-fashioned way of looking at business which makes
them think of haggling and bargaining as suspicious. Thoralf, their
chieftain, has even forbidden them to take part of the trading market.

In life the huecuvae were clerics or other religious figures who were cursed
for their crimes against their church to live on as one of the undead. In death
they hate with fervor their former church and the diety who cursed them. Some
go even so far as to actively seek the eradication of all faith.

The huecuvae are one of the most dangerous of the undeads for they are not only
intelligent but also highly skilled in magic. They have some apparent natural
aptitude for anti-magics, and possess a considerable resistance against all
forms of magic--a resistance that only grows through age--making a huecuva the
nightmare of a spellcaster.

A huecuva resembles a common skeleton very closely, and it is often mistaken for
one. While a huecuva is not physically very imposing, it can be extremely

 The most common of all races who dwell within the vast realms of Zombie,
 the spread of civilized humanity has crossed fertile plains and near
 endless oceans to settle even in the farthest reaches of the known world.
 Their true home, however, will always remain in the very heart of the
 realm; ZombieCity.

 One of the most varied of species, civilized humans are jacks of all
 trades. They are adept at mastering any skill or magical spell they choose
 to learn, yet tend to remain entirely average when such aspects as strength,
 wisdom, or any other physical characteristic is put to the test. It is for
 this reason alone that when distinctions are made between all races, human
 is the one which is always used as the solid basis for comparison.

 Being truly civil, each and every human child is schooled in various
 aspects to help them prosper in the city as adults. Basic knowledge of
 leadership, bargaining, appraisal, mathematics, and even some training in
 the fundamental precognition of magical spells known to most as 'essence
 eye' are among the lessons. With this training, when the time comes, they
 will be prepared to join the guilds of the lands and make their own names
 in the world.

 As with all species, there often comes a man, or woman, of such stature,
 such unparallelled rank and charisma, that they are unanimously elected to
 lead the race. Humans are no exception to this tradition, and when their
 leader is chosen, they are bestowed with the official title of Mayor of
 the greatest city in the entire realm; ZombieCity itself.

 During the early days, kobolds were once a free folk, free from
 enslavement. They lived peacefully at the continent of Cantador,
 a plentiful life with their kin and without any threats. Those days
 are long gone, peacefulness and tranquility are words not known to
 kobolds anymore. Kobolds were expatriated by pure force and persecution
 by humans. Since the kobolds were banished from the lands of Cantador,
 they migrated across the waters to south. They were pushed to the only
 possible direction, towards the vast glaciers north from Milky Pass,
 near Mariner's Grief. For a while the kobolds were alone at Grimhildr
 and they nourished and and built a fortress, Mared, near the feared,
 yet worshiped Areack, The Great mount of Xellios.

 After the migration kobolds faced a barren and cold land. Only their
 strong will and tenacity allowed them to survive. They developed
 thick and long fur to protect them from the icy winds of Grimhildr,
 which makes them look much like a small and furry orc. Their hands and
 feet end in strong claws, and they have the large and sharp teeth of a
 predator. Their wide oval eyes makes it easy for them to see during
 dark winter nights. Nothing grew in the barren land so kobolds had 
 to live on dead, mostly frozen, animals. Biting and ripping pieces of
 frozen carcasses strengthened their jaws and gave them the verve to gnaw.

 They still remember the brutal way they were forced to leave their home
 so they are extremely distrustful and sometimes even hostile against
 anyone who comes near their domain.

 When wandering through the world's sylvan forests, travelers should be wary
 of music and laughter coming from a clearing.  More than likely, the cause
 is the dance-loving Korred, a race that is close to nature and jealously
 protects its way of life.  Perhaps the most striking feature of these
 Gnome-sized race of humanoids is their wildly flowing beards and hair, which
 seem to snake out in all directions.  Their bodies are hairy, with their
 lower quarters being those of a goat.  Some humans descibe them as Satyrs
 with long hair that flows out in all directions.  The Korred wear little,
 usually only a pair of leather britches.  They smell like pine trees and
 fresh earth after a spring rainstorm.  A stout oaken cudgel is the favored
 weapon and no Korred is seen without his large leather pouches.  Although
 their relation to Satyrs may suggest that they are a weak race of thinkers,
 this is not true; Korreds possess giant strength for their small size.

The Melarni is a human race, very closely related to the people of
ZombieCity. They live mostly on the southwestern part of the continent
of Mellarnia. Parted by a great ocean from the rest of civilized
humanity, they do not share all the customs and teachings of other
human settlements. Continuous raids by the trolls and goblins roaming
the lands of Mellarnia has made it hard for them to build up any larger
settlements. So the Melarni mostly live in small remote villages in
locations that are not easily reached by the raiding parties. Much
effort has also had to go into the development of tactics and methods
for warfare instead of the trading and manufacturing of goods performed
by many of their brethren on Despair. As a result of this their leaders
reside in forts rather than castles.

When it comes to appearance they have some general characteristics
which make them differ from the humans of the center of Despair. Most
notable is that they tend to be smaller in size, and that they have
very straight, dark hair. Their eyes are, with very rare exceptions,
a dark brown in colour, and are commonly somewhat slanted.

tone tends to vary from a pale white in those that live in the northern
parts, to a dark tan in those that inhabit the southern coastline.

 The mind flayers are thoroughly evil beings, although this is not by
 choice nor is any action they take intentionally a malicious one.
 They just fail to comprehend the meaning of happiness, compassion or
 any positive emotion for that matter, and the closest to being content
 a mind flayer can get is when it is feeding on a brain, which they for
 some reason must devour. The emotions that drive a mind flayer forward
 are related to pride, twisted curiosity and self-satisfaction, and
 quite a few tend to be rather decadent and sadistic.

 Every now and then, for some reason, a mind flayer starts exhibiting
 the generally unknown emotions and the thoughts derived from them, and
 gets summarily banished from their community. For years, it has been
 these exiles that have wandered into the cities of men. It was not
 until very recently that rumours started circulating in Cantador,
 about a colony of this sinister race, of which nothing is truly known.
 The exiled members of the race have never even mentioned any cities of
 theirs, for whatever reason, and for long it was suspected that they
 have none. They never spoke of their origins, either, but there are
 old tales that claim that a mind flayer is actually a strange parasite
 that takes over a victim, changing its body completely, twisting the
 flesh into the hideous form, and as such one is not just born as a mind
 flayer.

 A typical member of the race resembles a thin humanoid with a gaunt,
 spidery build. A mind flayer's head looks like four-tentacled octopus,
 while some reports speak of encounters with individuals with a many as
 six face-tentacles. Under the prominent brow ridges, set deep in the skull,
 are two pupilless, uniformly milky white eyes. The soft skin of a mind
 flayer is typically a dark shade of mauve--although occasionally shades
 ranging from a blueish-green to dark purple are met--and is covered by a

 These creatures are humans with a bull's head, crowned with horns. They are
 called Minotaur, named after their home village Mi'otau. Their true origin
 is largely unclear, as they tend to keep their history and legends to themselves.
 Scholars theorize that they have been unfaithful to their god sometime in the
 past, but nothing is known for sure. What is known for a fact though, is that
 their village lies on the island called the Sands.

 Minotaurs are rarely seen outside their village, but when encountered, they
 always amaze people with their fighting ability, as well as their disdain
 towards magic. It is the former that makes them highly sought-after as
 mercenaries, to protect convoys, or to wage war.

 Minotaurs are about the size of humans, but much stronger. Their bodies are
 partially covered by fur that is brown to black in colour, while their
 complexion varies similar to that of humans. The horns of a minotaur are
 their pride, and a status symbol among them. Their horns begin growing from
 birth, continuing until death. Some of the older minotaurs have learnt
 to use their horns in a most deadly manner in combat.

Living deep underground, in the tunnels and mines of the Dwarven
Kingdom are the dwarves of the mountain clans. They work as miners,
explorers, warriors and sometimes even farm what little that can grow
beneath the earth.

Mountain Dwarves look quite similar to their brothers from Uhruul
when it comes to body shape and size. They also have the
characteristic dwarven beard growth, but there are differences.
Generations of time spent underground have led to Mountain Dwarves
losing most of their natural pigment, making their skin quite pale.
Their eyes, which give excellent vision in the underground tunnels,
are usually red and gleam with a dull light. This appearance has
quite often led to the misconception that Mountain dwarves are
sinister creatures, while they are in fact as friendly as any of
the other dwarven clans.

Leaving the safety and shelter of their underground dwellings is a
traumatic experience for any Mountain Dwarf. Under the open sky they
feel uneasy, weak or disoriented, longing for the safety of a sturdy
ceiling above their head. This of course makes it quite hard for them
to learn the ways of those who live and hunt under the open sky. The
rough life underground earns them other traits though, never getting
lost in the tunnels and having increased resistances against the
harsh conditions of the mines makes them more suited for their
environment than anyone else. They are also rumoured to be very
talented in using the tools of their trade. This comes in handy in
both of their major interests; mining gold and breaking skulls.

 Orcs are a species of aggressive mammalian carnivores that band together in
 tribes and survive by hunting and raiding.  They generally live underground,
 in very dark conditions.  Orcs believe that in order to survive they must
 expand their territory, and so they are constantly involved in war against
 many enemies.  Orcs vary widely in appearance, they frequently crossbreed
 with other species.  In general, they resemble primitive humans with
 grey-green skin covered with coarse hair.  Orcs have a slightly stooped
 posture, a low jutting forehead, and a snout instead of a nose, though
 comparisons between this facial feature and those of pigs are exaggerated
 and perhaps unfair.  Orcs have well-developed canine teeth for eating meat
 and short pointed ears that resemble those of a wolf.  Orcish snouts and
 ears have a slightly pink tinge.  Their eyes are human, with a reddish tint
 that sometimes makes them appear to glow red when they reflect dim light
 sources.

In life the revenant were men and women of extraordinary will and dark of heart.
Having met their end through falsehood, betrayal or murder these mortals rose as
undead revenant: vengeance and wrath embodied. Commonly a revenant will return
to their grave having avenged their death but sometimes their hatred is so great
that they will simply replace the face of their enemy with another's, starting a
neverending cycle of vengeance.

The body a revenant is gaunt, pale skin riddled with sharp creases giving them a
grotesque visage which is only compounded by the eyes that blaze with inner red
fire. With their appearance and the aversion to sunlight the revenant is often
mistaken for a vampire.

A revenant is a formidable opponent for they possess great strength, bordering
on monstrous when facing a hated enemy. They can also be very difficult to
destroy as the body of a revenant can withstand great punishment. Like most
undeads a revenant is vulnerable to magical forces but they are also vulnerable

Known for their love of the freedom of the waves, the elves of the great seas
have sung the ballads of their folk for as long as history can remember. They
are the voyagers and the tale spinners, marked by their will to travel the
vast lands, and yet always retaining the seemingly innate strength and wisdom
to return safely to their ancestral home of Eliendien time and time again.

Called the Maredien by their elven kindred, they bear the name of the beloved
sea whose waves wash tirelessly against the northern shores of the Elven
Isles. They possess the trademark slightly pointed ears of all elvenkind,
and yet unlike their Magudien bretheren, their skin shows the bronzing of
Silvain's sun high above; a testament to their long travels across open seas.

The voices of the sea elves are resonating and powerful, and they are said
to use them quite often whilst casually fishing or simply making their way
through the lands. They have been heard singing everything from low charms to
the smallest of creatures in the soil to far carrying trilling directly to
the ocean's waves, and even receiving the answering calls from all manner of
beasts. It has been told that their voices can charm even the water itself,

be true.

Chosen of Silvain, the Seraphs have existed since the dawn of time,
long before any mortal race. They were there to witness the birth of
the Mother of the Waters and the Moon. They stood by their Mistress'
side at the Time of Defiance, and the rise of the Dark Gods was their
final call to arms. They are celestial beings driven by a single
purpose, to wage war against The Hand of Mortos and to obliterate all
forms of evil from the face of the earth.

The vigorous efforts of the Seraphs to combat the forces of darkness
over the past millennia have made them the most visible celestial
beings. The image of large feathered wings, the beautiful Archaic
expression and a tall stature are all features that best describe the
Seraphs. Not much is commonly known about these heavenly warriors
besides their appearance, but their zealous and often unforgiving
nature, their great devotion to Silvain, and the perception of being
surrounded by awing luminance once confronted by one, are most often
repeated in the few credible sources.

One of the principle lessons amongst the clergy of the Church of
Silvain is that every Seraph was once a man who petitioned the Good
Goddess for a greater chance to serve, and was found worthy. This
petition is said only to be possible at the holiest cathedral ever
built on the mortal plane. There, at the sacred altar of the Great
Mother, the offer of servitude and allegiance can be made. Once one
has taken his vows, the petitioner can only seek to prove his worth
by dedicating his life to the servitude of goodness.

Skeletons are the animated bones of the dead, brought to unlife through some
type of dark magic. Most common type of a skeleton is the mindless automaton,
created through necromancy and fully controlled by the animating force. The
more dangerous and rarer type is the skeleton that has been animated by a curse
or by a possessing spirit for they are cunning and self-aware, and not just
necromancer's puppets.

While it can be argued that skeletons are one of the least formidable of the
undead, they still do possess a multitude of strengths and weaknesses commonly
observed among the ranks of the living dead. They are naturally resistant to
mortal ailments, like poison and disease, but tend to be highly vulnerable
against magical forces.

Through undeath a skeleton is also deceptively durable. While the exposed
skeletal frame is easy to damage, a skeleton is able to withstand a surprisingly
great amount of punishment and remain ambulatory. They have also been observed
to use the bones of the deceased to repair their own anatomy.

Some vague stories have been circulating among the populace, describing
skeletal creatures of gigantic proportions, but these have been disclaimed
by the clergy as being nothing but ravings of a madman.

invaded by demonic forces ages ago.  Though powerful and long-lived, it

 These independent warrior maidens, common in Norse lore, tend to 
 exhibit an affinity for combat as well as other tasks. Usually 
 seen at the sight of death and carnage, these virtuous females tend 
 to fend for their own, and have formed various tribes to worship 
 their deities. Within these tribes, a formidable fighter is made
 and combat-proven. With their wits, and their powerful manuevers,
 they overwhelm their opponent in many ways..
 Appearing as gigantic 'human' females, with beautiful yet muscular
 forms, matching them exactly except for size and powerful dispositions,
 these enchanted females catch many an eye with their passion for 
 fighting, as well as their natural assets. Though one does have to 
 worry, for these amazons tend to have a strong hatred towards the 
 opposite sex, namely males, and have a tendency to try to deal them
 some extreme bodily harm..

Vampires resemble pale humans with chiseled features, which to some appear
almost bestial or grotesque. They are nocturnal hunters, who have been
condemned into the endless night. They can not stand daylight or water, and
they are known to shun both of these elements. Unlike other undeads, they
must feed in order to avoid withering, yet they cannot eat normal food.
The pool of which the vampires draw their power is tradition, which is
guarded within their secretive communities. During the long centuries of
their shadow filled existence, they have become elegant and cultivated
hunters who prefer to live close to their prey, stalking them like cattle.
As the shadows begin to fall and the night wraps the world in its murky
shroud, they are the incarnation of fear of which the townsfolk and
villagers gather to tell horror stories.

Vampires are often envied because of their immortality and ability to toy
with death, but one can not simply be born into darkness. The concept of
pureblooded vampire is but a myth of ages past. Becoming a vampire requires
both, acceptance from a figure of power, in vampire hierarchy and desire
to embrace the night willingly.

A wight is the corpse of a warrior who fell in a great battle only to rise as an
undead, through the possession by an evil spirit, a curse or necromancy. Those
animated by necromancy are rarely nothing more than mindless automatons and by
and large are hardly more imposing than skeletons or zombies. But a wight created
by a possession or a curse retains its intelligence and skills from their life
before, and as mighty as the warrior might have been in life, it is now in
undeath truly a force to reckoned with.

As warriors many a wight has a near obsession for battle and the improvement of
their considerable skill with weapons. Like all undead a wight is naturally
resistant to poisons and diseases but is also highly resistant to cold - the latter
suggesting to some a connection to the cold climates and that the reason for their
growing numbers on the glaciers of Despair goes beyond the mere proximity of the
Castle Greenlight.

There have been some rumours of wights brought to being by the hand of Mordiggian
himself but most people have dismissed these as mad delusions or attempts to sow
paranoia and fear. Generally, the common folk blame the paladins for spreading such
tales in an attempt to justify the existence of their order of waning glory.

 Eons ago, by foul means now long forgotten, the race of Wolfmen was
 given birth. Not true birth, but one through blood and magic. While the
 true origins of these lupine beasts remain shrouded in the past, the
 race of Wolfmen roam the lands by their own right. A right earned by
 their ancestry, who in their small numbers and against all odds broke
 free from their creators and prevailed. These tribal, yet intelligent
 beings like the humans they once were, now seclude themselves into their
 camp in the Anar forest, hunting and raising their young as taught by
 their fathers and forefathers who came before.
 
 Their packs are known and feared throughout the realm for their brutal
 force, a feat that only true Wolfman hunters can obtain through
 countless struggles and battles experienced shoulder to shoulder with
 their brothers. Yet at home, when the sounds of battle are far away,
 these beastial beings take care of their families and nurture their pups
 with love. There are Wolfmen that dedicate their lives not for the Hunt,
 but to attain a closer affinity with their Ancestry. Yet even these
 shamans are quite often seen hunting with their packs.
 
 The tribe of Wolfmen is dominated by the males. Being both stronger and more
 agile than their female counterparts, their duty is to train the young ones
 and keep the tribe fed while the females take care of the more mundane
 tasks. A Wolfman is quite peculiar in the way that they choose to eat only
 what they hunt, and hunt they must as they tend to have quite an appetite.
 
 A male Wolfman is a sight one does not easily forget. Possessing the strength
 and dexterity of a wolf, yet otherwise human characteristics, these
 beings walk on two legs and speak the languages of the realm. Their
 teeth are known to tear through the strongest armour. Their fur keeps
 them warm on the cold seasons. Rumors say that a Wolfman can reach
 inwards into his being to uncover their inner wolf, but for the young
 such a state of mind might not be so easily mastered.

The hunters and trail breakers of Eliendien, the wood elves are said to know
the lay of the lands as well as they know the faces of their own children.
Stronger of build than their other elven bretheren, the elves known as the
Silvadien are at home in the deepest and darkest of groves.

Seen oftentimes with the young beasts which each elf in turn helps to raise
for the Rangers of the land, they are highly skilled in many aspects of a
Ranger's life. Sharing many of the same values as those who find their path
through the world leading to Artimis and his teachings, the Silvadien seem
to only truly differ from his ways when the subject of one's personal
selection of weaponry is raised. Wood elves of course bearing the name of
their impliment of choice, the fine boughs and bounty of the forest itself,
they choose to fight most often with techniques associated with grace and
skill, rather than brutal hacking force.

Most comfortable with bows and staves than any article made of steel, they
have even adapted a form of fighting which all elves may learn, and that is
the way of the Loc Ecsuram. Some say that these teachings guide one deeper
and deeper within, always drawing on the true power of the soul, but only
the elves really know, for no other race has ever learned their strange ways
with a stave.

Wraiths were once mortal mages, sorcerers and other practitioners of magic who
tried to extend their own life with dark magics. But such powers are not known
for creating life, instead they were all irrevocably and horribly corrupted by
the unholy rituals.

The fate of a wraith could be said to be the worst of all undead, for through
their desire for life they were cursed to have an insatiable hunger for the
life force of others but to have none of their own. The wraith envies and hates
all living things for they are a constant reminder of its utter failure.

Through the transformation the mind of a wraith is warped and they are all
altogether evil, some nothing more than mindless instruments of hunger and
destruction. The wraith is however exceedingly intelligent and, like it did in
life, possesses great affinity for magic. Some have even been known to delve
further into the realm of dark magic to increase their powers beyond ordinary
limits.

The wraiths are creatures of darkness and when exposed to any light they will
quickly weaken and eventually disintegrate completely. Contrary to a popular
belief the wraith is not completely non-corporeal and can be harmed with
conventional weaponry.

 Sometimes confused with the abominable snowman, the Yeti is a distant cousin
 to the great carnivorous apes of warmer climates.  An adult Yeti stands 8
 feet tall and is covererd in long, white fur.  Their feet and hands are wide
 and flat, which helps to disperse their great weight (about 300 pounds) on
 treacherous snow fields.  They travel on all fours like the apes, but fight
 very comfortably standing erect.  Unlike most apes and gorillas, the Yeti
 does not have an opposable toe on its feet.  They wear no clothing or
 ornamentation.  The spoor, or smell, of a Yeti is very subtle in cold
 climates, but in confined or warm areas, they have a strong, musky odor.  The
 eyes of a Yeti are icy blue or almost colorless.  They have a transparent
 second eyelid, which allows the creature to see in blowing snow, and
 prevents its eyes from freezing in extreme temperatures.  Their claws and
 flesh are ivory white.  Unlike many arctic creatures, the Yeti does not have
 a thick layer of body fat to keep it warm.  Instead, it relies upon the
 special properties of its thick, warm fur.

Zombies are perhaps the most common of undeads and are easily recognized with
their rotting flesh and slow, wavering gait as they stumble from one feast to
another. Most zombie are utterly mindless cadavers that can do very little more
than follow simple orders.

Every so often a zombie manages to hold on to a dim spark of intelligence in its
transformation and such a rarity is not only tough like all zombies but is also
capable of independent thought. But even as it retains to its former
personality, it is bound by the everlasting hunger for flesh which it must
consume constantly in great quantities. Regardless of the intellect of a zombie,
in hunger it will become a feral thing, single-minded in its pursuit for flesh.

Contrary to some beliefs, a zombie is not an evil thing by nature, retaining
their freedom of will as they retain their personality from before their death.
While a feral zombie might seem evil, it is in effect nothing more than a
mindless animal with no concept of morality.

As an undead, a zombie has a variety of strengths and weaknesses common to all
of the living dead. It possesses a natural resistance to the typical mortal
ailments, such as poisons and diseases.

There have been some rumours going around, claims of zombies of great intellect
and magical talent, but most have dismissed these as wild fantasies of peasants
and drunks who have no clue of what they speak of.
