Help on spell:   Bestow unlife
Casting time:    6 rounds
Spell cost:      247 SPs
Spell type:      heal
Spell words:     xi kraka-ze
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, rites of the grave, constitution,
                 fell insights, unhallowed magic, cure undead and wisdom

Just as healers have ways of transferring their own life to another in order to
heal wounds, the undead have devised their own magics of similar fashion. But,
instead of life the undead transfer unlife to revitalize the deathless animation
of another. This spell can be cast only by an undead and, naturally, has no
effect at all on the living.
Casting this spell while on a 'fell gravesite' will increased its power
proportionally to the power of the gravesite.

Help on spell:   Profane sacrament
Casting time:    12 rounds
Spell cost:      513 SPs
Spell type:      neutral
Spell words:     qhau mor kaalbht
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, rites of the grave, profanities,
                 constitution, fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

This rite channels the unholy power of a 'fell gravesite' to bestow a profane
blessing to all undeads present, with the exception of the spellcaster. The
power of the blessing is governed to a great degree by the power of the fell
gravesite.
While it is possible to channel a gravesite constructed by another, the
sacrament is most powerful when channeling one's own gravesite.

Help on spell:   Gravesight
Casting time:    5 rounds
Spell cost:      402 SPs
Spell type:      neutral
Spell words:     ctkkya-nyth hrae
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, rites of the grave, constitution,
                 fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

This spell bestows upon the subject the otherworldly sight of the true undead.
While under the influence of this enchantment the subject can not only see in
complete darkness but can also see both the invisible and magical auras.
Additionally, as the subject does not use any conventional ocular anatomy to
see while this spell is in effect, they are completely immune to blindness.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on spell:   Theft of vitality
Casting time:    2 rounds
Spell cost:      125 SPs
Spell type:      attack
Damage type:     magical
Spell words:     khaz mor-naqq xi
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, constitution, eldritch weave,
                 ruinous utterance, fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

A sinister spell that allows the caster to steal the lifeforce of another to
heal themselves. The potency of this spell is greatly increased by the use of
Shadow magic, even as rudimentarily as it is woven alongside common magics.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Gravechill
Casting time:    2 rounds
Spell cost:      146 SPs
Spell type:      attack
Damage type:     cold
Spell words:     eer aaen ak-az
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, constitution, rites of the grave,
                 ruinous utterance, fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

Drawing its power from the undead's form, this spell channels the spellcaster's
unearthly essence in a quick, glacial burst. This is not a natural cold however
but the cold of death and worlds' beyond. And as such, this spell is highly
ineffective against the undead and other beings beyond the reach of conventional
death.
This spell can be cast only by an undead.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Spectral touch
Casting time:    1 round
Spell cost:      102 SPs
Spell type:      attack
Damage type:     magical
Spell words:     tra tho-ras vy
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, constitution, eldritch weave,
                 ruinous utterance, fell insights, unhallowed magic, wisdom and
                 dexterity

A basic spell to emulate the crippling touch of many an ethereal being of the
more sinister disposition. Upon the incantation, even the briefest of brushes
with one's fingertips, the lifeforce of the victim is devoured and sometimes the
spellcaster may even claim some of stolen life as their own.
This spell is only minimally effective against the undead.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Malediction
Casting time:    3 rounds
Spell cost:      80 SPs
Spell type:      curse
Spell words:     gol ikkeq xom
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, profanities, constitution, fell
                 insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

This spell bestows a temporary curse on the subject weakening some of their
physical or mental attributes, or make them otherwise more vulnerable.
The curse can only be bestowed upon living beings of good alignment.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Spectral armour
Casting time:    5 rounds
Spell cost:      412 SPs
Spell type:      defensive
Spell words:     xexa yidhe vyyl
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, constitution, eldritch weave, fell
                 insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

Shrouds the subject with phantasmal energies that not only serve to shield them
from attacks but may also make the subject exceedingly difficult to hit.
The downside of channeling such forces is that for the duration the subject
becomes more suspectible to magical damage.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Necrotic blight
Casting time:    3 rounds
Spell cost:      217 SPs
Spell type:      curse
Spell words:     ro-cthak yz naqq
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, profanities, rites of the grave,
                 constitution, fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

A sinister spell which curses the victim with necrotic energy, a black rot of
the flesh. While thus infected, the victim's flesh is more vulnerable to injury
and will heal much slower, even magical healing is hindered. The final insult of
this fell curse is that the victim will rise as undead, should they die while
infected with the necrotic blight.
This curse has no effect on the undead or those who have no flesh.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Diminish decay
Casting time:    3 rounds
Spell cost:      101 SPs
Spell type:      neutral
Spell words:     vy raas n'vrall
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, rites of the grave, constitution,
                 fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

A simple yet useful utilization of the caster's deathless essence woven with
rudimentary necromantic magics. The spell allows the caster to channel their own
essence to reinforce the undead body of another, slowing down the decay and
allowing it to regenerate its wounds faster. Interestingly, if cast on an
already dead body, this spell will completely halt the decay of the corpse.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Ward living
Casting time:    6 rounds
Spell cost:      92 SPs
Spell type:      neutral
Spell words:     knaath zeqq-ra
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, fell warding, constitution, rites
                 of the grave, fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

Fashions a warding around a location, preventing the living from entering or
leaving either physically or magically. If cast on a 'fell gravesite' the
warding will last at least as long as the gravesite. The warding can be
dispelled at will by the spell's caster or by any undead.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Call of the grave
Casting time:    6 rounds
Spell cost:      67 SPs
Spell type:      curse
Spell words:     kke thaqqia xur
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, rites of the grave, constitution,
                 fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

Bestows a curse of mortality upon the subject, albeit a brief one. For the
duration the subject is more vulnerable to all magics of the undead and, if
they possess it, lose the ability to escape from death. This spell is more
effective against the undead than it is against the living.
The curse becomes more severe if it is bestowed while on a 'fell gravesite'
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Eldritch ward
Casting time:    10 rounds
Spell cost:      323 SPs
Spell type:      defensive
Spell words:     aza nrakk-thaal
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, constitution, fell warding, ward
                 living, eldritch weave, fell insights, unhallowed magic and
                 wisdom

Using the deathless essence of its subject as a catalyst, this spell conjures an
aura that repels the living, protecting the subject from various methods of
attack, both physical and magical. Due to its nature this spell is minimally
effective against the undead and can only be cast on one. The magnitude of the
protection is to an equal degree governed by the might of its subject as it is
by the skill and power of its creator. The ward is the most powerful when cast
on oneself.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Stygian fire
Casting time:    4 rounds

Spell words:     gnis uvrakk ath

                 rites of the grave, fell insights, unhallowed magic, soul wrack
                 and wisdom

An unpredictable burst of energies fueled by the undead body of the spellcaster,
that may either freeze the victim or burn their essence. This wild surge is not
only unpredictable but also highly uncontrollable and its coherence will vary
greatly even when cast by the most powerful undeads.
This spell can only be cast by an undead.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Gravegate
Casting time:    5 rounds
Spell cost:      146 SPs
Spell type:      teleport
Spell words:     ythui cthn-gai nraa
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, rites of the grave, constitution,
                 fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

By traversing the pathways of death this spell transports the undead caster into
the Necropolis, the morbid sanctuary of the dead and the death knights. This
spell can also be used to travel to any fell gravesite if the caster is familiar
with their construction or possesses substantial knowledge of the rites of the
grave.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Undead servitor
Casting time:    8 rounds
Spell cost:      871 SPs
Spell type:      neutral
Spell words:     lgeth ngoqq shtlgtya
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, profanities, rites of the grave,
                 constitution, fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

This profane spell reanimates the corpse of a single being, sentient or animal,
as an undead. These undead servitors are relatively weak and virtually mindless
who will not act by themselves nor react to any stimuli apart from defending
themselves unless commanded by their creator. Even then, their ability to follow
orders is limited.

The magic that binds this undead servitor is only temporary and eventually will
dissipate, rendering the undead inanimate and the corpse invalid for any further
reanimation attempts. Similarly, if the servitor is killed, the corpse cannot be
reanimated again.

The binding magic requires some active control and concentration from the caster
and thus it is not possible to have multiple servitors. If a new one is created,
the previous servitor will be rendered inanimate.

If cast while on a 'fell gravesite' the reanimated undead servitor will be
stronger proportionately to the power of the gravesite.

The remains of non-living or undead beings cannot be reanimated with this spell.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Invigorate unlife
Casting time:    6 rounds

Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, rites of the grave, bolster unlife,
                 cure undead, constitution, fell insights, unhallowed magic and
                 wisdom

A more advanced version of 'bolster unlife' that not only provides greater
healing to the undead subject but also restores a small amount of stamina.
Casting this spell while on a 'fell gravesite' will increased its power
proportionally to the power of the gravesite.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Fell gravesite
Casting time:    6 rounds
Spell cost:      280 SPs
Spell type:      neutral
Spell words:     iqqua glaa-hort xa
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, rites of the grave, profanities,
                 fell warding, constitution, fell insights, unhallowed magic and
                 wisdom

An unholy ritual that uses the deceased remains of sentient beings to defile the
land. A fell gravesite is a sanctuary for the undead and not only are they
gradually restored both physically and magically during their stay within, but
many of their spells are empowered by the profane enchantment. Some spells draw
their power directly from the fell gravesite and as such can only be cast while
on one.
The number and the nature of corpses used in the desecration governs the power
of the gravesite to a great degree.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Gravemist
Casting time:    10 rounds
Spell cost:      583 SPs
Spell type:      neutral
Spell words:     ka-chraii ux aam
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, rites of the grave, constitution,
                 fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

Conjures a permeating otherworldly mist, the vapours of which improve both the
physical and magical regeneration of all undeads within. The mist has no effect
on the living but it will instantly devour the conjured smoke of a healer. The
mist will quickly dissipate if subjected to sunlight.
If cast on a 'fell gravesite' the conjured mist is considerably strengthened.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Power of the dead
Casting time:    3 rounds
Spell cost:      206 SPs
Spell type:      neutral
Spell words:     zi cthauroqq ix
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, rites of the grave, profanities,
                 constitution, fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

With this spell the magic of a 'fell gravesite' can be absorbed, bestowing
great power to the spellcaster, albeit for a relatively brief time. The
magnitude and, to a degree, the nature of the gained boon are governed by the
power of the gravesite. The fell gravesite is destroyed in the process and all
spells, that may rely on it, are dispelled.
While it is possible to absorb a gravesite constructed by another, this spell
is most effective when absorbing one's own gravesite.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Profane halo
Casting time:    6 rounds
Spell cost:      431 SPs
Spell type:      neutral
Spell words:     ras ma-kraan xe
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, profanities, rites of the grave,
                 constitution, fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

This spell conjures around the death knight a freezing aura, but not that of
earthly cold but of the chill of the grave. All who engage the death knight in
melee are exposed to the unnatural cold and sometimes even the death knight's
allies may be caught within.
This spell is minimally effective against the undead.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Gravegate
Casting time:    5 rounds
Spell cost:      150 SPs
Spell type:      teleport
Spell words:     ythui cthn-gai nraa
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, rites of the grave, constitution,
                 fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

By traversing the pathways of death this spell transports the undead caster into
the Necropolis, the morbid sanctuary of the dead and the death knights. This
spell can also be used to travel to any fell gravesite if the caster is familiar
with their construction or possesses substantial knowledge of the rites of the
grave.

Help on spell:   The vengeful dead
Casting time:    6 rounds
Spell cost:      408 SPs
Spell type:      neutral
Spell words:     iqquat xe nkaht
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, rites of the grave, profanities,
                 fell warding, constitution, fell insights, unhallowed magic and
                 wisdom

Both a necromantic enchantment and a profane blessing that is intertwined with
the essence of the undead subject to construct a reactive augmentation. While
the spell is in effect, any injuries sustained by the subject will fuel the
magic and thus strengthen the augmentation. The spell will quickly diminish and
eventually dissipate altogether should the subject not be engaged in battle or
otherwise be subjected to repeated injuries.
While this spell may be cast on any undead, it is much more effective if the
subject is fully sentient and even more so if the subject is the spell's caster.
The spell is more powerful if it is cast while on a 'fell gravesite'.

Spell words:     l'qua ryen cthas'nar
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, profanities, constitution, fell
                 insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

A malevolent curse that devastates the victim's soul with fell magic, depriving
them of their will to live. In their despodent state, the victim's efficacy in
combat is severely hindered. It will take some time, however, for the curse to
reach its full strength.

Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, profanities, constitution, fell
                 insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

This spell bestows an unholy enchantment on a weapon, making it a bane of the
living. While the weapon can be wielded successfully by any creature, it is most
useful in the hands of an undead or someone of evil alignment.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Gravegate

Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, rites of the grave, constitution,
                 fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

By traversing the pathways of death this spell transports the undead caster into

spell can also be used to travel to any fell gravesite if the caster is familiar
with their construction or possesses substantial knowledge of the rites of the
grave.

                 quench life, eldritch weave, fell insights, unhallowed magic and
                 wisdom

An immensely powerful but highly volatile amalgamation of the arcane and the
Shadow that aims to unravel the victim's lifeforce with a single, chaotic burst.
However, the wild force of this spell can be very difficult to control, making
it a somewhat unreliable weapon, although with skill this can be mitigated.
Casting this spell while on a 'fell gravesite' will increased its power
proportionally to the power of the gravesite.
This spell is minimally effective against the undead and creatures of the
Shadow.

Using the deathless essence of its subject as a catalyst, this spell conjures an
aura that repels the living, protecting the subject from various methods of
attack, both physical and magical. Due to its nature this spell is minimally
effective against the undead and can only be cast on one. The magnitude of the

by the skill and power of its creator. The ward is the most powerful when cast
on oneself.

                 utterance, rites of the grave, eldritch weave, fell insights,
                 unhallowed magic, soul wrack and wisdom

An explosive burst of energies from beyond the grave using the deathless body of
the spellcaster as a conduit. This fell eruption is somewhat unpredictable and
may freeze the living beings caught within the blast to their bones or burn
their very essence. Sometimes, it may even channel the Shadow itself.
Casting this spell while on a 'fell gravesite' will increased its power
proportionally to the power of the gravesite.
This spell can only be cast by an undead.

Spell words:     nnyer chrai xe llyago
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, rites of the grave, constitution,
                 fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

This spell allows a death knight to exert brief control over virtually any
substantially inferior undead, compelling them to perform a single, simple task.
The subject must have at least a semblance of a mind and must not be under the
active control of anyone, like a necromancer.
Any creature will over time build up a resistance to this type of domination.
---------------------------------------------------

Help on spell:   Eldritch burn
Casting time:    3 rounds

Spell words:     aam tha-zul
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, constitution, eldritch weave,
                 ruinous utterance, fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

This spell cannot be tumbled.

This spell is a fusion of what is commonly accepted as normal magic and the
Shadow magic, albeit a crude one - an attempt of channeling the powers of the
dark mirror of the universe. By focusing the negative properties of the Shadow,
the caster can effectively ignite the mana of the target, not only consuming
some of it but also causing pain to the target, proportionally to the amount
of mana burned. As this is not a true spell of the Shadow, it is fully affected
by all talents of ordinary magic.

                 constitution, fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

A basic utilization of necromantic magics to mend minor injuries of an undead.

proportionally to the power of the gravesite.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on spell:   Quench life

Spell words:     ngyr ithra qua
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, constitution, ruinous utterance,
                 fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

This spell cannot be tumbled.

Fueled by the Shadow, this spell seeks to assail the victim's essence. As this
this is merely a crude hybrid of traditional magic and Shadow magic, the spell's
capacity for channeling the pure destructive power of the Shadow is unreliable.
But, as such, it is fully subject to the various conventional talents of magic.
Casting this spell while on a 'fell gravesite' will increased its power
proportionally to the power of the gravesite.
This spell is minimally effective against the undead and creatures of the Shadow.

Help on spell:   Profane sanctuary

Spell words:     cthaat ve zul
Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, constitution, rites of the grave,
                 profanities, fell insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

This unholy spell desecrates a place, albeit temporarily. Any living being
caught within the influence of a profane sanctuary will find their lifeforce
being sapped, resulting in a variety of adverse effects to their physique. The
power of the sanctuary is even more ruinous if it is created on a 'fell
gravesite' and will last as long as the gravesite.
The caster of the spell must expend some amount of mana constantly to maintain
the sanctuary, but can 'dispel' it at will
---------------------------------------------------

Affecting stats: spell percent, intelligence, profanities, constitution, fell
                 insights, unhallowed magic and wisdom

A sinister albeit brief curse that infects the victim's essence with fell magic,
gradually draining their health and magic. The curse will sometimes convey some
of the stolen life or magic to the caster, replenishing their magical energy.
The curse will very quickly wear off, however, if the caster is no longer in
the immediate vicinity of the victim.

veil of Shadow has a tendency to sap the subject's mana, but less so if the

result of the conventional magics' imitation, it is fully affected by the common
magical talents.

Casting time:    3 rounds
Spell cost:      64 SPs
Spell type:      neutral
Spell words:     ksant iat a navitu
Affecting stats: intelligence and spellpercent

As spellblades typically seek to defeat their enemies by exploiting their
weakness, they must first learn of those to be effective. While both abjurers
and bards possess the necessary magics for that purpose, the required training
is far too extensive for them to be practical. And so, with the help of master
abjurers and several bards, the spellblades managed to solve this problem
and designed this spell: a relatively simple divination that offers some
insight into the greatest weaknesses of the target.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on spell:   Augmented strikes

Spell cost:      648 SPs

Spell words:     ilt klo tsalb-ters tes
Affecting stats: intelligence, spellpercent, various attack spells, magical
                 transformation, alternate magics and channel power or nerve
                 mastery

To compensate for the typically weak physique, at least when compared to someone
with proper martial training, spellblades employ powerful magics. While most
of their spells are directed inwards to improve their abilities or are about
subversion, this magical stance is all about force.
With each martial technique, the spellblade channels magical energies through
his weapon into a powerful blast. Each delivered blast will sap an amount of
mana from the caster. The type of the energy is chosen as the stance is assumed,
and can be of type: acid, cold, electric, fire, magical or psionic. If the
weapon through which the blast is channeled has been enchanted with the same
type, the resulting blast will be improved relative to the strength of the
enchantment. Additionally each spell of destructive nature which the spellblade
knows that is of the same type further empowers the blast.
The stance will last indefinitely, slowly draining the caster's mana, until the
caster no longer possesses a sufficient amount to maintain the spell or chooses
to dispel it.
Only one magical stance can be active at any given time.

attempt to resist this banishment, causing it to be literally torn to

of teleportative magics.

his opponent to deliver a quick jab or a slash, benefiting greatly from the

Casting time: 6 rounds.
Spell cost: 989 SPs.
Spell type: neutral.
Spell words: Xeratox daimio sword.
With this spell, the Samurai calls upon the Four Winds to carry
his samurai blade from the Spirit World. The samurai blade is the
primary weapon of any Samurai, and each such blade is unique to its
wielder, reflecting the Samurai's chosen proficiencies. The Artists
of Samurai are known for their ability to enchant their weapons with
superior hit and damage bonuses, while the Samurai Shogunate are
reputed to be unmatched in their ability to enchant the weapon's class.

The Samurai's overall knowledge of the Way of the Samurai and his
proficiency in Call for Sword determines the blade he is initially
provided with. The extent of the Samurai's studies in the guild
determines the maximum extent to which the blade may be enchanted.

The Samurai are trained to perform many special attacks with their
blades, some of which are based on spiritual enchantments, while others
rely on physical skill. These special attacks are an inseparable part of
the Way of the Samurai, and while it is possible to perform such attacks
while employing arts unfamiliar to the Samurai training, success is less
likely than while following the ancient traditions.

Syntax: Cast call for sword at <blade's name>.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on spell: Call spirit.
Casting time: 20 rounds.
Spell cost: 999 SPs.
Spell type: neutral.
Spell words: Spiridam roes spiridam roes.
Conventional undead are usually walking corpses, once dead flesh animated in
a foul imitation of life. A different type of undead is created when the
tortured remains of souls and spirits that still reside in their rotting
caskets are called forth and given form by pure negative energy. Spirits are
not useful in the same sense as the other undead, by not being able to
physically interact with this world. However, when used correctly, they are
extremely deadly. A spirit is able to siphon the warmth of life from a victim
or severely destabilize the very bonds that tie every one of us to this plane.
For the spirit to be able to successfully channel negative energy, the
controlling necromancer must transfer his own mental energy to it. The power
of the spirit depends on spell knowledge and the weight of the corpse.
Also, a necromancer may only have a single spirit at a time.
The commands to use with spirits are: sphit and spdon.

out of the air and enchant the water, turning it into an
adhesive magical liquid that settles on the target's skin. 
This liquid neutralizes any caustic substances connecting
with it. Unfortunately, it cannot always fully cover the
protected, thus leaving him or her vulnerable if an attack is
lucky enough to connect with unprotected tissue.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on spell:   Celerity

Spell cost:      475 SPs
Spell type:      neutral
Spell words:     devropmi tsahe
Affecting stats: intelligence, spellpercent, nerve mastery, magical
                 transformation and transmutation

While the physique of an spellblade is subpar to that of a fully trained
warrior, they are able to wield strange and powerful magics to even the field.
Based on the principles of the 'arcane infusion' this enchantment the result of
countless hours spent in observation of the true masters of 'combat trance'.
With the magical augmentation of the physique an spellblade is able move and
act much faster in combat, striking more often in melee.
This enchantment will however interfere with the delicate balance of the true
combat trance, and they should not be employed simultaneously.
Once cast, the enchantment will slowly drain the caster's mana but will last
indefinitely until the caster chooses to dispel it, or runs out of mana.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on spell: Chain.
Casting time: 7 rounds.
Spell cost: 45 SPs.
Spell type: neutral.
Spell words: Zechan mool gnaur.
Affecting stat(s): level and intelligence and spell knowledge.
While it is possible to command an undead minion to move into a desired
direction with the 'control' spell, it would require unnecessary effort
and strain to command the creature every time. Therefore, it is possible
to forge a more permanent link that simply forces the undead to follow the
caster around blindly. The negative energies surging inside the undead will
cause this spell to fade after a certain amount of time that depends on the
caster's level, intelligence and spell knowledge.

to one's foes. It is known that the ability to perform this
song is very draining on the bard; the less people the bard

Help on spell: Control.
Casting time: 1 round.
Spell type: neutral.
Spell words: urak.
Affecting stat(s): willpower, level and spell knowledge and wisdom.
Generally, most of the undead plaguing our world are almost mindless,
little more than mere automatons. However, a skilled necromancer can
project his considerable willpower and force an undead being to perform
simple tasks for him, such as movement, fighting and basic item manipulation.
The undead creature is unaware of being commanded, as the unholy essence
guiding it is simply overridden by the sheer power of the necromancer's mind.
A strong link between the necromancer and his minion is required, effectively
rendering this spell only useful on undead beings the caster has himself animated.
Syntax: 
  - kill  causes the undead to attack the target.
    'cast control at <number>/<name> kill
    <target>'
    <number> is the undead number to be
    controlled.
    sp cost depends on target's level, caster's 
    wisdom and spell percent.
  - direction causes undead to move current direction
    'cast control at <number>/<name> <direction>
 Other working commands are (syntax is equal to players): 
 get, drop and keep.

 on caster's level.
 1 undead at level 1
 2 undeads at level 14

Spell type: attack.
Damage type: cold.
Maximum damage: 1450.
Spell words: moleculos friitzos.
Affecting stat(s): level, int, spell percent and mastery of psychokinetics.
This spell enables the psionicist to suppress the molecular motion in a target
creature, causing frostbites on skin, for example. The amount of damage done
depends on how long the caster has concentrated to suppress the molecular motion
in the target creature. Additional spell points are consumed when keeping up the
concentration. Quick chant, spell percent and mastery of psychokinetics
affect the time needed to suppress the molecular motion in order to reach a
certain temperature level (and finally maximum damage level).

Help on spell: Cryptic spark.
Casting time: 1 round.
Spell cost: 9 SPs.
Spell type: attack (projectile).
Damage type: psionic
Spell words: aori sheeol hic.
Affecting stat(s): mostly intoxication, spell percent, hints of dexterity and intelligence or charisma (depending on the mood)
  The origin of this spell is lost in a mist--of the the merry, heavily
intoxicated kind of mist. At some point during a rather boisterous party,
one reveler decided to entertain the people with some tricks of the Magus
Artiste. For whatever reason, an attempted star prism become something
quite different. Instead of the expected magical bolt, a missile of odd but
incredibly potent psionic substance was conjured (the poor sod who got in
its path drooled uncontrollably for a week).
  Even today the why and the how of this spell is completely unknown,
but it has been duplicated by several other Artistes via extensive trial
and error. It is quite unclear whether its the intelligence or the
charisma of the Artiste that governs the potency of the spell, as there
has been little consensus of the matter. They do all agree of one thing,
however, to get something out of this spell, one must be drunk.. heavily.

Undead creatures, by virtue of being dead, obviously do not heal like living
beings do. They do get damaged by combat though, and because of that exists
this necromantic spell that can be used to repair the damage done to them.
Necromancers are not healers, and this spell is quite a bit more crude than
spells that are used to heal living beings. For this reason, this spell will
only work on undead.

Help on spell: Deadly attention.
Casting time: 2 rounds.
Spell cost: 45 SPs.
Spell type: defensive.
Spell words: Oal g'Alno!.
The undead are mindless creatures, dreaded among even the bravest of warriors
for the total disregard of their own welfare. Thus, a necromancer can exert
control over them and force any of his minions, perhaps one that is better
protected by magic or simply less wounded, to bear the brunt of an attack.
Enslaved undead obey the whims of their master unquestioningly, and this spell
can only expire due to a major disturbance in the controlled undead horde, such
as an undead being killed and the negative energy animating it escaping.
To remove the effect prematurely, this spell should be cast at the caster himself.

Maximum damage: 290.
Spell words: ex morituri.
Affecting stat(s): spell percent and wisdom.
With the extensive knowledge of what makes up an entity
comes the knowledge of where the greatest flaws in its design
exist. Abjurers' of ages past have used this knowledge to inform
their companions of the weaknesses in their mutual opponents, as well
as to cast the spells of vulnerability. This knowledge can also be used
more directly, to cause direct injury upon an opponent, and due to the
implementation of sophisticated knowledge of the elemental and magical lores,
this injury will be the type the target is the least resistant to. Eventough
useful for when no suitable company is around, this spell is rather inefficient
and weak in comparison to the spells more adept guilds are able to conjure. This
is due to the fact that abjurers' research never aimed for results such as this.
It came to being from necessity alone.

carries an enchantment meant to enhance the efficiency of one's

it seems that the magic also slows down the metabolic rate of the
enchanted person, causing him or her to heal slower.

against physical harm. Energy hauberk requires more mana than 
similar spells a lot simpler in their design, but on the other 
hand it lasts longer granting more powerful protection.

Help on spell: Enlarge spirit.
Casting time: 10 rounds.
Spell cost: 666 SPs.

Spirits can be thought of as vessels of pure negative energy.
The amount of energy a single spirit can channel depends on its size,
and sometimes a necromancer wishes to increase the capacity of his spirit
instead of calling a new one in order to avoid the exhausting and terrifying
planar journey. For this purpose, this spell allows a necromancer to increase
the amount of negative energy a spirit can absorb by fusing it with the spirits
of fresh corpses. The amount how much the spirit is enlarged is highly dependent
on spell knowledge and naturally, how powerful the used corpse is.

Help on spell:   Flaw-seeking eye
Casting time:    5 rounds
Spell cost:      648 SPs

Spell words:     av toraant atiovaj
Affecting stats: intelligence, spellpercent, assess weakness, spot weakness, know
                 your audience, greater vulnerability, immunal disorder, effusion
                 of entity and magical lore

This ingenious amalgam of sorcerous magics and abjuration aims to capitalize on
the opponent's weaknesses. While in this stance the elemental or magical portion
of the spellblade's martial techniques are warped in such a way that it does
not attack the resistances of the opponent directly but seeks to circumvent them
in a most efficient fashion possible. The magic cannot, however, fully bypass
any resistance, for it merely shifts the natural resistances of the opponent the
briefest of instants aiming to effectively deliver the attack like it was of the
elemental or magical type that the opponent is least resistant to.
Each delivered hit that utilizes this magic will drain an amount of mana from the
caster.
The stance will last indefinitely, slowly draining the caster's mana, until the
caster no longer possesses a sufficient amount to maintain the spell or chooses
to dispel it.
Only one magical stance can be active at any given time.

Help on spell: Flickerfire.
Casting time: 3 rounds.
Spell cost: 37 SPs.
Spell type: attack (projectile).
Damage type: electric.
Spell words: tsis astorl.
Affecting stat(s): intelligence, dexterity, charisma and spell percent.
  As the Magus Artiste began coming up with their own unique spells most
attempts were total failures, but a few experiments were more successful
even if highly unpredictable.
  This spell was dubbed 'flickerfire' due to its very chaotic nature, that
manifests itself in several ways. To begin with it is difficult to predict
the actual time it takes to cast this spell. Secondly, the resulting bolt
has been found to manifest as fire, electricity and pure magical energy,
assuming a nature completely randomly. The composition of the projectile
also varies from a highly focused bolt to a more sporadic burst, that is
more difficult to aim with the usual precision.
  While the power and the cost-effectiveness of this spell are highly dependant
on the intelligence and skill of the caster, there is a certain artistic
component involved in the conjuration; some have likened the casting of an
Artiste's spell to a process of molding clay rather than actual magecraft.
This is evident in the fact that charisma, and especially dexterity, determine
the power of the 'flickerfire' to a great extent.

Affecting stat(s): int, level and spell percent.
The story behind the creation of this spell tells of a promising young
mage named Mandok, who tried to shortcut his way to perfecting his magic.
While working on the element of fire, he apprenticed for the greatest
master of the element, Gendaran himself. During his training, he accidently
stumbled upon the very essence of fire, and seeing the opportunity to become
more powerful than his master, he stole it and escaped. Knowing that the
essence would be too much for a mere mortal and that it would eventually
corrupt Mandok, Gendaran allowed him to leave. What Mandok didn't expect
is to be hunted by the mage guild, who punished him by taking the essence.
Mandok had already been corrupted, and his spirit could no longer be saved.
The fire essence now resides within the safe keep of the guild, and every
member who has proven her power and loyalty can call upon the essence.
The spell summons whirling magical energies to a location pointed out by
the caster, which turn the air into blazing whips of fire. The flames
consume everything in their path, burning flesh to charred pieces of meat
and boiling the blood out of victims, and even vaporizing bones. Though
the spell's power derives from the usage of the essence itself, it takes
time and practice for highly skilled mages to perfect this spell's
power and learn to manipulate the magical essence in a way, that it grants
protection to the comrades of the caster from the wicked hellish flames.

energy, potentially reducing the opponent's resistance to the magical or
elemental energy the spellblade's weapon is enchanted with. However, the
resulting vulnerability is very brief and nowhere near as significant as one
caused by the spells of the abjurers.
Each delivered hit that utilizes this magic will drain an amount of mana from the
caster.
The stance will last indefinitely, slowly draining the caster's mana, until the
caster no longer possesses a sufficient amount to maintain the spell or chooses
to dispel it.

you. There are also several kinds of beasts that are able to

An old legend tells that the first mage guild leader had horrible breath.
One of the mage's apprentices - a bright young student wanted to play a prank
on his friend and curse her temporarily with exceptionally bad breath just
like the teacher had. The spell somehow went all wrong, and the student
ended up killing half her class. Eventually, the expelled student studied
the area of the spell and managed to refine it to be suited for combat.
As a war began ravaging the nearby lands, the student, seeing an opportunity
was accepted back to the guild, as the spell proved itself by being put
into very effective use.
This spell allows the advanced magician to magically enhance the poison
elements of his breath much like the assassins do with herbs and alchemy.
The conjured cloud engulfs the target making its every breath a wrestle
with death. The cloud is big enough to affect a reasonable area - a room
for example - and everyone in it. The caster's companions will not be
affected, as they have already got used to the bad breath.

mastered the result is very unstable and unpredictable. Only after years of

element. Being the sum of all the arcane studying the successful binding of
the spell is highly dependant on the knowledge of the easier offensive
mage spells.

Help on spell: Raise dead.
Casting time: 10 rounds.
Spell cost: 989 SPs.
Spell type: neutral.
Spell words: Gnaaahss raaag wwwar.
Usually, undead are rather stupid and unable to learn anything from their
experiences, but there is an exception. Necromancers are able to entrap
wandering souls into a corpse, creating a dark servant. These servants are
intelligent and versatile, and will serve their masters well, being actually
able to specialize in a player guild and use corresponding skills and spells.
There is a drawback, though, as the servant will be like a newborn when it is
first summoned, and to advance, it will leech experience from its master, much
like a party member would in a party. This experience will be saved over reboots
and 'reincarnations' of the servant, if it is raised again to a different guild.
All in all, it behaves much like a player would. The servant cannot wear
equipment, save for weapons, and its statistics will depend on the equipment
its summoner is wearing during casting. The servant's power and development
is relative to its master's status in necromancy.
Syntax: 'cast raise dead at <corpse> make <guild>' for making a new servant.
  'cast raise dead at <corpse>' for restoring current servant.

Powerful and arcane abjuration has conquered new ground
with this spell, created by an elite few of an inner
circle of the Abjurer guild. By mastering a combination of 
runic magic and basic invocations, the creators of
this spell were able to create a potent new way to decrease
multiple natural resistances of a creature with one 
concentrated ray of energy. At first this evocation was 
kept a secret and tested for anomalies, but as time went by
a risk of potential abuse gave rise, and a decision to
unveil the details of the spell was made. With this spell
a ray of condensed magic is created, which upon connecting
with a target will severly decrease his or her resistances
against cold, corrosive substances, psionic damage, poisons 
and physical damage.

existence. Flesh golems are huge creatures, consisting of large masses
of rotten flesh and muscle fused together by dark magic.

corpse and some other preparations done to it.

of life to serve its master. This spell reanimates a corpse with energy
from the negative energy plane, stripping it of all remaining flesh and creating
a horrific skeleton. Skeletons, although being the weakest kind of undead, are
extremely ferocious, some unimaginable desire driving their simple-minded existence.

corpse and some other preparations done to it.

carries a powerful enchantment meant to enhance the efficiency of
one's respiration. The enchantment is very strong and it greatly

Casting time: 3 rounds.
Spell cost: 30 SPs.
Spell type: attack (projectile).
Damage type: magical.
Spell words: sherie oseril.
Affecting stat(s): intelligence, dexterity, charisma and spell percent.
  The crowning achievement of the magical experiments of the Magus Artiste.
The spell 'scintillating flare' is capable of conjuring a powerful bolt of
pure magical energy strong enough to rival the spells of Mages, falling short
only from the very greatest. What gives this spell an edge over many, is its
high propability of disrupting the target's concentration, and in some cases
even causing lasting disorientation.
  As is the trend with the arts of the Magus Artiste, there is an element of
unpredictability in this spell--but while there is a great variance in the time
it takes to conjure the bolt, for some reason those with the greatest agility
and charisma have been noticed to get quicker and more even results. The actual
effectiveness of the conjured bolt is not only greatly dependant on the
intelligence and skill of the caster, but also their artistic flair as
characterized by their agility and charisma, of which the latter also reduces
the magical drain of the spell.

Spell cost: 250 SPs.
Spell type: neutral.
Spell words: Shiand drygh aurn.
When the reanimation of a truly great and deadly undead is desired,
the tedious process of merging myriad corpses together can rather quickly
become a real problem. This spell is a much more advanced version of the
spell 'soul merge', and is capable of simultaneously fusing every suitable
corpse in the room into one. The efficiency of this spell is affected to a
great degree by spell knowledge and also the knowledge of the lesser spell
'soul merge'. This spell requires no target to cast.
---------------------------------------------------
Help on spell: Soul merge.
Casting time: 5 rounds.
Spell cost: 50 SPs.
Spell type: neutral.
Spell words: Shiand aurn.
Obviously, a single corpse often does not contain enough power to create
a truly powerful and fearsome undead creature. This spell alleviates this
problem, by enabling the very flesh and spiritual residue in two corpses to
be merged, with slight losses. This spell can be recast an unlimited number
of times, each time adding the essence of two corpses together and making it
heavier and thus more powerful. The power that is lost in the merging process
is highly dependent on the caster's spell knowledge. Enchanted corpses cannot
be merged.
Usage: cast soul merge at corpse <x> and corpse <y>

Casting time: 8 rounds.
Spell cost: 375 SPs.

This spell is a lesser invulnerability against electric damage.
The abjurer unleashes a burst of magical energy which enters 
the target's body and creates a network of tendrils, each 
tendril controlling electrical currents entering the body by 
channelling the energies past any vital organs and back out 
again. This creation is not perfect, and the subject may 
experience occasional jolts in the nervous system.

Spell words:     invocia validus
Affecting stats: intelligence, spellpercent and iron will

powerful, but it is cost-effective and will last indefinitely as long as the
caster has enough mana to maintain it.
However, should the spellblade possess knowledge of the spell 'iron will'
this enchantment will be almost as strong as it is.

Casting time: 1 round.
Spell cost: 39 SPs.
Spell type: attack (projectile).
Damage type: magical.
Spell words: thua shorei.
Affecting stat(s): Affecting stats: intelligence, dexterity, charisma and spell percent.
  One the first spells the Magus Artiste have come up with by themselves.
This spell is essentially an advanced 'magic missile' -- while it does not
necessarily provide a dramatic advancement for the purposes of straight-forward
onslaught, the conjured projectile is far more accurate and is more likely
to strike vital areas. In the hands of a skilled Artiste the spell is also
capable of disrupting the victim's concentration.
  While the dexterity of the caster is a notable factor with 'star prism'
in general, the most important characteristics are intelligence and charisma.
An intelligent Magus Artiste is able conjure a powerful prism, but still
cannot hope to compete with a truly charismatic Artiste in whose hands the
prism is also more cost-effective.

and should he become separated from them and unable to
find them through normal means, the help of this spell is required.
This spell will summon the caster's horde back to him by locating
and dragging them through the negative energy plane. The potential
energy difference is too great for this spell to be cast on the
material plane, and thus this spell will only work if the caster

frail elves, and always teleported away to heal when they were hurt,
before any of them died. Knowing that they would be seriously pinned
down if things continued like this, the elves altered the magic of
the spell by giving it a slight chance to fail, so that the vortex of
the portal might appear in a random dimension. The elves withstanded
a number of attacks, and eventually triumphed when the horde of the
demons grew shorter and shorter with each attack, until the attacks
stopped completely. In this world, the target of the spell is prefixed

tougher by draining and donating power from a corpse to it to make it more
resistant to damage. While this spell does increase the toughness an undead
has, it will not make it any stronger. The efficiency of this spell is

Executing a number of teleportative leaps in rapid succession the spellblade
seeks to strike at all of his opponents from surprising angles, circumventing
their defenses. While the principle of this maneuver is simple, the execution is

disorienting effect, possibly hin

until reaching a certain integer defined as the hit point maximum. The rate
at which hit points increase in this periodic manner can itself be increased,
including by use of magical incantations such as the 'spell that increases
the increase of hp'. Unfortunately, while this spell increases the rate at
which hit points automatically increase, it also decreases the amount of
spell points held by the caster.

hp for the target.

The spell known as 'spell that reduces sp and reduces hp' is a magical
incantation that subtracts spell points from the caster, resulting in
the subtraction of a usually larger number of hit points from the
target. After subtracting enough hit points from a target, the caster
can receive various forms of virtual currency which are subsequently
used to increase the caster's power, so that the caster may cast more
spells that reduce the caster's spell points and reduce the victim's hit
points.
